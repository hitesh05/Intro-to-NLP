<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr <EOS>	6.671753721206922

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join <EOS>	7.211719125880477

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my <EOS>	6.180228357013515
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham.wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison.but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry.the necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurd.i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country.but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.i had often seen him in love before.at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their <EOS>	7.844918713861458
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be <EOS>	5.771218408857729
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard.but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult <EOS>	7.038900811955651
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them.with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my <EOS>	7.282522800031377
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally <EOS>	7.211719125880477
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in <EOS>	5.866842010825683
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers <EOS>	7.248747682074272

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an <EOS>	7.566480440871132

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of <EOS>	7.092974423588428

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own <EOS>	6.035756856319554

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its <EOS>	6.634724293164914

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her <EOS>	7.293131167174724
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at <EOS>	7.141388487536665

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the <EOS>	7.400068483403646

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his <EOS>	7.198570800162678

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the <EOS>	7.455385495659846

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the <EOS>	7.236788793426273

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered <EOS>	7.170943821019367

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously <EOS>	7.260345754255357

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr <EOS>	6.706856451936717

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had <EOS>	7.248747682074272

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> at present we have nothing to guide <EOS>	4.544209071498869

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from <EOS>	7.019443955342838
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can <EOS>	6.933220946371466

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an <EOS>	7.414894473037197

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy had been at her sisters <EOS>	4.544209071498869

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected <EOS>	5.866842010825683
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy called and was shut up with him several <EOS>	5.132036957500384

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia <EOS>	6.706856451936717
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for <EOS>	6.3615090556320295
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in <EOS>	6.884278779551959
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the <EOS>	6.554216716401523
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his character was to speak for <EOS>	4.293422401174083
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by <EOS>	6.244886481337671
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace <EOS>	5.426304982158432
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow <EOS>	6.978115559749559
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say <EOS>	6.80199548565183
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting <EOS>	5.771218408857729
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to <EOS>	6.463792293003369
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he <EOS>	5.771218408857729
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with <EOS>	6.706856451936717
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor <EOS>	4.958937002444641
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they were in <EOS>	3.285295070035791
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing <EOS>	4.764352392575034
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would <EOS>	6.9991984869696875
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she <EOS>	5.132036957500384
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving <EOS>	6.110706865383714
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify <EOS>	5.954723124084382
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ <EOS>	6.706856451936717
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly <EOS>	6.80199548565183
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about <EOS>	6.110706865383714
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live <EOS>	6.110706865383714
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at <EOS>	5.426304982158432
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by <EOS>	6.595605688657698
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate <EOS>	5.866842010825683
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they met several times for there was much to be <EOS>	5.132036957500384
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be <EOS>	5.866842010825683
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> every thing being settled between _them_ mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came <EOS>	6.634724293164914
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next <EOS>	6.554216716401523
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the <EOS>	6.706856451936717
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on <EOS>	6.244886481337671
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> on saturday he came <EOS>	3.6728503235444143
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk <EOS>	6.180228357013515
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they met again on sunday and then _i_ saw him <EOS>	5.132036957500384
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but our visitor was very <EOS>	4.005623370923401
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the <EOS>	6.884278779551959
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was <EOS>	7.384494203189552
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at <EOS>	5.426304982158432
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young <EOS>	5.552324557747837
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission <EOS>	6.634724293164914
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he <EOS>	6.706856451936717
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybodys_ reserve can be answerable for the <EOS>	6.244886481337671
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the <EOS>	6.830717262184083
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last <EOS>	7.057614183758726

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to <EOS>	7.657092225613067

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially <EOS>	7.236788793426273

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her <EOS>	6.80199548565183
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated <EOS>	6.706856451936717
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed <EOS>	6.110706865383714
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the latter was much more agreeable than his companion <EOS>	4.958937002444641

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest <EOS>	7.3418882008835755
