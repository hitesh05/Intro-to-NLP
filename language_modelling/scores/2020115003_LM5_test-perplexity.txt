<SOS> he was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely agreeable  and to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party <EOS> 234.94931799656018

<SOS> missingley is to live with her brother and keep his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her <EOS> 146.9200681050017
<SOS> in understanding darcy was the superior <EOS> 322.7424684464429
<SOS> bingley was by no means deficient  but darcy was clever <EOS> 282.4534502060023
<SOS> bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life  every body had been most kind and attentive to him  there had been no formality  no stiffness  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  and as to missennet  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful <EOS> 280.26945167246095

<SOS> another time  lizzy   said her mother   i would not dance with  him   if i were you <EOS> 119.53600570327774
<SOS> a person may be proud without being vain <EOS> 440.1095877142689
<SOS> pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves  vanity to what we would have others think of us <EOS> 379.0610656596652
<SOS> by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure  but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body  hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  though their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration <EOS> 243.60489439821012
<SOS> we can all  begin  freely  a slight preference is natural enough  but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement <EOS> 413.02573933959667
<SOS> well   said charlotte   i wish jane success with all my heart  and if she were married to him to morrow  i should think she had as good a chance of happiness  as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth <EOS> 138.24651863203803

<SOS> there is nothing like dancing after all <EOS> 283.76313944580045
<SOS> you have a house in town  i conclude <EOS> 154.05333445511425
<SOS> and taking her hand  he would have given it to mr darcy  who  though extremely surprised  was not unwilling to receive it  when she instantly drew back  and said with some discomposure to sir william   indeed  sir  i have not the least intention of dancing <EOS> 333.6098926494497
<SOS> mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand  but in vain <EOS> 190.2785289750979

<SOS> i wonder my aunt did not tell us of  that <EOS> 263.6578643595005
<SOS> bennet   that is very unlucky <EOS> 204.3496565554119
<SOS> that would be a good scheme   said elizabeth   if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home <EOS> 119.33114565476126
<SOS> but if you have got them to day   said elizabeth   my mother s purpose will be answered <EOS> 159.81908725225554
<SOS> her sisters were uneasy for her  but her mother was delighted <EOS> 170.79391088409542
<SOS> i shall be back by dinner <EOS> 260.8299446366236
<SOS> we will go as far as meryton with you   said catherine and lydia <EOS> 270.7576833518021
<SOS> the advice was followed readily  for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head ached acutely <EOS> 488.02607395616207
<SOS> at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner <EOS> 571.3500044900106
<SOS> missingley was engrossed by mr darcy  her sister scarcely less so  and as for mr hurst  by whom elizabeth sat  he was an indolent man  who lived only to eat  drink  and play at cards  who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout  had nothing to say to her <EOS> 240.42711394266766
<SOS> what could she mean by it <EOS> 156.24696349049543
<SOS> it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence  a most country town indifference to decorum <EOS> 534.9783954894177
<SOS> she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep  and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself <EOS> 173.66175611391162
<SOS> mr hurst looked at her with astonishment <EOS> 380.5897495526047
<SOS> she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else <EOS> 237.92677608662385
<SOS> what a delightful library you have at pemberley  mr darcy <EOS> 225.78912985515578
<SOS> and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always buying books <EOS> 196.15157862419167
<SOS> upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation <EOS> 370.0430019075349
<SOS> elizabeth was so much caught by what passed  as to leave her very little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly aside  she drew near the card table  and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game <EOS> 289.7605445976261
<SOS> i think she will <EOS> 83.09594829600056

<SOS> eliza bennet   said missingley  when the door was closed on her   is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex  by undervaluing their own  and with many men  i dare say  it succeeds <EOS> 307.17325559591245
<SOS> but  in my opinion  it is a paltry device  a very mean art <EOS> 170.5233832887798
<SOS> bennet  accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast <EOS> 726.8171932394573

<SOS> cried bingley <EOS> 473.5228262769935
<SOS> i am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed  and suffers a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the world  which is always the way with her  for she has  without exception  the sweetest temper i ever met with <EOS> 158.45674031460604
<SOS> yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing <EOS> 633.7575690981466
<SOS> they have at least that advantage <EOS> 294.9221433760041
<SOS> i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part  except the shops and public places <EOS> 329.19000926358143
<SOS> so genteel and so easy <EOS> 365.2307020451254
<SOS> but every body is to judge for themselves  and the lucases are very good sort of girls  i assure you <EOS> 272.9197380044047
<SOS> not that  i  think charlotte so  very  plain  but then she is our particular friend <EOS> 280.04000330387976
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> i have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love   said darcy <EOS> 133.7599486110562
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> yes  it would be much better to wait till jane was well  and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again <EOS> 269.8191351392094
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> bennet and her daughters then departed  and elizabeth returned instantly to jane  leaving her own and her relations  behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy  the latter of whom  however  could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her   in spite of all missingley s witticisms on  fine eyes <EOS> 180.70708446070012
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> i have already told her so once  by your desire <EOS> 222.2481183173458

<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> it is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes an indirect boast <EOS> 399.3343447130793
<SOS> and which of the two do you call  my  little recent piece of modesty <EOS> 411.24220163521477
<SOS> when you told mr <EOS> 266.0664885695175
<SOS> nay   cried bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning <EOS> 398.95795513266694
<SOS> at least  therefore  i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies <EOS> 440.8347627157492
<SOS> you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine  but which i have never acknowledged <EOS> 275.32862549696523
<SOS> but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend  where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment  should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire  without waiting to be argued into it <EOS> 324.38560833825807
<SOS> will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request  as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties <EOS> 202.04617493411087
<SOS> if you and missennet will defer yours till i am out of the room  i shall be very thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me <EOS> 194.11919531928157

<SOS> elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying  and burying his parishioners whenever it were required <EOS> 236.48688839460982
<SOS> and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail <EOS> 195.40620414689965
<SOS> can he be a sensible man  sir <EOS> 277.5192007041722
<SOS> i am impatient to see him <EOS> 72.93517166631977
<SOS> to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting <EOS> 423.3629854853171
<SOS> you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate <EOS> 136.56824521250894
<SOS> i am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins   and could say much on the subject  but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate <EOS> 178.85209805450694
<SOS> they were not the only objects of mr collins s admiration <EOS> 93.26018325863008
<SOS> mr bennet could not have chosen better <EOS> 128.87784221883982
<SOS> lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty  misse bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth <EOS> 467.7358332411408
<SOS> mr bennet accepted the challenge  observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements <EOS> 275.69421804831035
<SOS> as to her  younger  daughters she could not take upon her to say  she could not positively answer  but she did not  know  of any prepossession   her  eldest  daughter  she must just mention  she felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon engaged <EOS> 255.55139595347242
<SOS> this was agreed to  and mr <EOS> 267.69953343834055
<SOS> the prospect of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual good spirits <EOS> 310.17547545370064
<SOS> when this information was given  and they had all taken their seats  mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire  and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification  but when mr <EOS> 291.4775630006649
<SOS> philips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could <EOS> 226.3101988288788
<SOS> about a month   said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the subject drop  added   he is a man of very large property in derbyshire  i understand <EOS> 313.16794665361095
<SOS> but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish  and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else <EOS> 255.4563680701362
<SOS> he is not at all liked in hertfordshire <EOS> 119.83459343259226
<SOS> i cannot pretend to be sorry   said wickham  after a short interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts  but with  him  i believe it does not often happen <EOS> 199.71511789911875
<SOS> i should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an ill tempered man <EOS> 231.25282632191323
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> no  it is not for  me  to be driven away by mr darcy <EOS> 68.30345615362288
<SOS> i knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them <EOS> 347.1221464653017
<SOS> a man of honour could not have doubted the intention  but mr darcy chose to doubt it  or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance  imprudence  in short any thing or nothing <EOS> 207.3521143680639
<SOS> what can have induced him to behave so cruelly <EOS> 249.8766122690074
<SOS> he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood  the sort of preference which was often given me <EOS> 197.1109416656647
<SOS> i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you <EOS> 86.12467342573221
<SOS> it has often led him to be liberal and generous   to give his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants  and relieve the poor <EOS> 303.9547973516339
<SOS> after many pauses and many trials of other subjects  elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first  and saying   i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley <EOS> 192.56117731418786
<SOS> do you know mr bingley <EOS> 89.87898996800222
<SOS> the whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered round the other table  and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mr <EOS> 457.58079098534154
<SOS> philips began to express her concern thereupon  he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance  that he considered the money as a mere trifle  and begged she would not make herself uneasy <EOS> 295.2034987974981
<SOS> i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long <EOS> 175.77225660169836
<SOS> no  indeed  i did not <EOS> 126.55265420571327
<SOS> vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself  if he were already self destined to another <EOS> 213.18062204942515
<SOS> elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it  and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham s attentions <EOS> 264.3719572695088
<SOS> interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other <EOS> 720.3247717981354
<SOS> it is  in short  impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side <EOS> 317.39562964241946
<SOS> no <EOS> 124.98598510253437
<SOS> i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on  than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night  names  facts  every thing mentioned without ceremony <EOS> 269.3638686304104
<SOS> i beg your pardon   one knows exactly what to think <EOS> 462.0372101521473
<SOS> the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed  by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking  mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield  which was fixed for the following tuesday <EOS> 225.013733353432
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> society has claims on us all  and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body <EOS> 414.3736274531269
<SOS> her liveliness had been never worse timed <EOS> 216.05083183453763
<SOS> no aunt  no officers  no news could be sought after   the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy <EOS> 243.39746652849863
<SOS> when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas  and was in conversation with her  when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy  who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand  that  without knowing what she did  she accepted him <EOS> 260.03158437090224
<SOS> i dare say you will find him very agreeable <EOS> 193.8477646622626
<SOS> elizabeth made no answer  and took her place in the set  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy  and reading in her neighbours  looks their equal amazement in beholding it <EOS> 253.8593100127697
<SOS> but  now  we may be silent <EOS> 218.80759299880884
<SOS> how near it may be to  mine   i cannot pretend to say <EOS> 211.37808247662565
<SOS> at length darcy spoke  and in a constrained manner said   mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making  friends  whether he may be equally capable of  retaining  them  is less certain <EOS> 358.9730645862355
<SOS> it is evident that you belong to the first circles <EOS> 94.02718564127973
<SOS> what congratulations will then flow in <EOS> 495.9865650709173
<SOS> i appeal to mr darcy   but let me not interrupt you  sir <EOS> 208.5019812267883
<SOS> you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me <EOS> 213.69094774176176
<SOS> the  present  always occupies you in such scenes  does it <EOS> 279.1950723234002
<SOS> i hope not <EOS> 99.55908200561294
<SOS> may i ask to what these questions tend <EOS> 328.06860146146596
<SOS> i am trying to make it out <EOS> 104.98921895226965
<SOS> i do not get on at all <EOS> 91.63368585505619
<SOS> i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly <EOS> 508.5793575774357
<SOS> jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening <EOS> 277.1918079984938
<SOS> mr bingley does not know the whole of his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy  but he will vouch for the good conduct  the probity and honour of his friend  and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received  and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s  mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man <EOS> 151.54860712515108
<SOS> mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself <EOS> 121.65422731158968
<SOS> i am perfectly satisfied <EOS> 207.09539108465833
<SOS> she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each  and on which there could be no difference of sentiment <EOS> 200.51839216081692
<SOS> elizabeth listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard  and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it <EOS> 289.6533778800485
<SOS> you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy <EOS> 107.48075655704126
<SOS> i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier <EOS> 417.4402083277575
<SOS> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong to mr darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the acquaintance <EOS> 230.16703876995714
<SOS> her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow  and though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words  apology    hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh <EOS> 207.93639838268382
<SOS> his being such a charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from them  were the first points of self gratulation  and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane  and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do <EOS> 203.8774439808523
<SOS> for heaven s sake  madam  speak lower <EOS> 1644.0387957315306
<SOS> if i   said mr collins   were so fortunate as to be able to sing  i should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the company with an air  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman <EOS> 202.56588435628132
<SOS> and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body  especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment <EOS> 303.6804928266329
<SOS> and with a bow to mr darcy  he concluded his speech  which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room <EOS> 138.59872903137523
<SOS> in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room <EOS> 284.805619092953
<SOS> she owed her greatest relief to her friend missucas  who often joined them  and good naturedly engaged mr collins s conversation to herself <EOS> 251.74122866187233
<SOS> she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy s farther notice  though often standing within a very short distance of her  quite disengaged  he never came near enough to speak <EOS> 293.68620661531736
<SOS> the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  and by a manoeuvre of mr <EOS> 153.11370250338524
<SOS> bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn  and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley  to assure him how happy he would make them  by eating a family dinner with them at any time  without the ceremony of a formal invitation <EOS> 235.2679777395935
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> of having another daughter married to mr collins  she thought with equal certainty  and with considerable  though not equal  pleasure <EOS> 406.24564265434276
<SOS> chapter xix <EOS> 689.3290951024985
<SOS> bennet instantly answered   oh dear <EOS> 1515.6071693407155
<SOS> jenkinson was arranging misse bourgh s foot stool  that she said   mr collins  you must marry <EOS> 286.0298588005707
<SOS> you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe  and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite <EOS> 302.18068528438977
<SOS> this has been my motive  my fair cousin  and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem <EOS> 233.2885854947608
<SOS> to fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of that nature on your father  since i am well aware that it could not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents <EOS> 169.5111140866554
<SOS> i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long <EOS> 192.01025754160563
<SOS> i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time <EOS> 219.94686358389785
<SOS> i wish you very happy and very rich  and by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise <EOS> 251.8085558554841
<SOS> my reasons for believing it are briefly these   it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance  or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable <EOS> 398.4349469766451
<SOS> my situation in life  my connections with the family of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances highly in my favour  and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you <EOS> 288.8023480727846
<SOS> cried he  with an air of awkward gallantry   and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals will not fail of being acceptable <EOS> 390.9072231404163
<SOS> but depend upon it  mr collins   she added   that lizzy shall be brought to reason <EOS> 289.84502849923587
<SOS> lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these <EOS> 301.53396964869324
<SOS> of what are you talking <EOS> 262.0418430368433
<SOS> of mr collins and lizzy <EOS> 91.78641376206774
<SOS> lizzy declares she will not have mr collins  and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy <EOS> 87.49510950184438
<SOS> it seems an hopeless business <EOS> 714.4107429782889
<SOS> very well  and this offer of marriage you have refused <EOS> 292.6394745016619
<SOS> very well <EOS> 225.60420859898633
<SOS> elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning  but mr <EOS> 159.22327877751542
<SOS> my dear   replied her husband   i have two small favours to request <EOS> 246.94985433953258
<SOS> not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband  did mr <EOS> 279.83953686719076
<SOS> mr collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had passed <EOS> 276.29091711048665
<SOS> i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children <EOS> 143.94525099828056
<SOS> in a doleful voice mr <EOS> 189.2830648268784
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> my dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this point <EOS> 397.02333217896506
<SOS> far be it from me   he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your daughter <EOS> 284.5714273446996
<SOS> after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned  and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball <EOS> 297.56359701829376
<SOS> mr bingley will not be detained in london by them <EOS> 103.06365530650847
<SOS> caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter <EOS> 984.0827443946337
<SOS> i  will  read you the passage which particularly hurts me <EOS> 255.01793450225188
<SOS> i will have no reserves from  you <EOS> 85.06383030787623
<SOS> my brother admires her greatly already  he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  her relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a sister s partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart <EOS> 384.18259921030045
<SOS> with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest jane  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many <EOS> 244.9689075426767
<SOS> to put me on my guard <EOS> 283.4380575145098
<SOS> yes  there can  for mine is totally different <EOS> 708.3610020230911
<SOS> they agreed that mr <EOS> 318.62734776691894
<SOS> such was missucas s scheme  and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night  she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon <EOS> 226.37893171015492
<SOS> the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion <EOS> 261.24540969728827
<SOS> the least agreeable circumstance in the business  was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person <EOS> 470.8528708229636
<SOS> my dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible <EOS> 141.37193342314947
<SOS> i never was <EOS> 109.87401409665515
<SOS> elizabeth quietly answered  undoubtedly    and after an awkward pause  they returned to the rest of the family <EOS> 291.5547591833032
<SOS> the strangeness of mr collins s making two offers of marriage within three days  was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted <EOS> 203.59764554361453
<SOS> chapter xxiii <EOS> 166.10274213462912
<SOS> bennet  with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil  boisterously exclaimed   good lord <EOS> 758.2753414375918
<SOS> sir william  how can you tell such a story <EOS> 434.3899528747932
<SOS> jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable <EOS> 326.254774409395
<SOS> kitty and lydia were far from envying missucas  for mr collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton <EOS> 189.46115186424205
<SOS> her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious  as bingley had now been gone a week  and nothing was heard of his return <EOS> 257.20514365770305
<SOS> after discharging his conscience on that head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour  missucas  and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible  which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men <EOS> 290.3966282381562
<SOS> bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood <EOS> 342.27878065748195
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins  was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr bennet were dead <EOS> 163.76684414533148

<SOS> her heart was divided between concern for her sister  and resentment against all the others <EOS> 259.2705214226111
<SOS> to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to missarcy she paid no credit <EOS> 289.9734538949627
<SOS> it was a subject  in short  on which reflection would be long indulged  and must be unavailing <EOS> 226.57461164615918
<SOS> he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance  but that is all <EOS> 145.01677405657028
<SOS> i  only want to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself against it <EOS> 282.45461298285693
<SOS> the more i see of the world  the more am i dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense <EOS> 242.18843532216562
<SOS> i have met with two instances lately  one i will not mention  the other is charlotte s marriage <EOS> 342.8719303493524
<SOS> it is unaccountable <EOS> 187.19285074053528
<SOS> in every view it is unaccountable <EOS> 319.87674600685045
<SOS> i must think your language too strong in speaking of both   replied jane   and i hope you will be convinced of it  by seeing them happy together <EOS> 208.5625325025092
<SOS> but if i go on  i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem <EOS> 169.67708213037037
<SOS> stop me whilst you can <EOS> 515.1708501267985
<SOS> your first position is false <EOS> 273.874249937601
<SOS> they have known her much longer than they have known me  no wonder if they love her better <EOS> 289.046618433495
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly  there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity <EOS> 418.0790504297687

<SOS> between the two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a very particular regard <EOS> 498.7084323483388
<SOS> they had frequently been staying with her in town <EOS> 222.12076906290446
<SOS> bennet had many grievances to relate  and much to complain of <EOS> 289.89750509456417
<SOS> the lucases are very artful people indeed  sister <EOS> 357.82989375527865
<SOS> however  your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you tell us  of long sleeves <EOS> 183.37721709360184
<SOS> an excellent consolation in its way   said elizabeth   but it will not do for  us <EOS> 211.44201391412867
<SOS> i never saw a more promising inclination <EOS> 302.6291961709801
<SOS> he was growing quite inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her <EOS> 258.2738080166612
<SOS> we live in so different a part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her <EOS> 279.1057116277779
<SOS> and  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of his friend  and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london <EOS> 77.26420877403639
<SOS> my dear aunt  how could you think of it <EOS> 121.4540037682445
<SOS> she will drop the acquaintance entirely <EOS> 468.6027331747752
<SOS> missennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time  than as she hoped that  by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without any danger of seeing him <EOS> 250.5910072365534
<SOS> to mr <EOS> 312.9833010912405
<SOS> in comparing her recollection of pemberley  with the minute description which wickham could give  and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor  she was delighting both him and herself <EOS> 165.42429073158584
<SOS> do not involve yourself  or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent <EOS> 299.4833867577417
<SOS> elizabeth  you are not serious now <EOS> 176.32648824798937
<SOS> i beg your pardon <EOS> 379.3563218950249
<SOS> i see the imprudence of it <EOS> 91.13832927079582
<SOS> as i did the other day   said elizabeth  with a conscious smile   very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that <EOS> 167.94630808995478
<SOS> promise me  therefore  to come to hunsford <EOS> 351.34385390080814
<SOS> it was mr collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there  to know the rest <EOS> 171.8997035720899
<SOS> jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys <EOS> 200.3965580306954
<SOS> my aunt   she continued   is going to morrow into that part of the town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street <EOS> 271.8910319109885
<SOS> after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight  and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her  the visitor did at last appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  the alteration of her manner  would allow jane to deceive herself no longer <EOS> 252.98587865823959
<SOS> my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment  at my expence  when i confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in missingley s regard for me <EOS> 215.9556549635714
<SOS> i do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me  but      if the same circumstances were to happen again  i am sure i should      be deceived again <EOS> 141.9547663490568
<SOS> but i pity her  because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong  and because i am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it <EOS> 147.591176485278
<SOS> she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions <EOS> 149.13309656081537
<SOS> chapter iv <EOS> 650.3110894982852
<SOS> the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew near  she would have been very sorry for any delay <EOS> 200.787750684677
<SOS> the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time  and the plan became perfect as plan could be <EOS> 303.5626691295763
<SOS> his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention  the first to listen and to pity  the first to be admired  and in his manner of bidding her adieu  wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their opinion of her  their opinion of every body  would always coincide  there was a solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced  that whether married or single  he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing <EOS> 246.8799522494457
<SOS> it was a journey of only twenty four miles  and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon <EOS> 251.56041799851494
<SOS> the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in bustle and shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres <EOS> 117.87344939643877
<SOS> where does discretion end  and avarice begin <EOS> 1121.623078189365
<SOS> last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent  and now  because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds  you want to find out that he is mercenary <EOS> 258.9867368760761
<SOS> no  why should he <EOS> 475.96643532533216
<SOS> i should be sorry  you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire <EOS> 167.62446589383092
<SOS> my dear  dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight <EOS> 321.3677016396101
<SOS> what are men to rocks and mountains <EOS> 217.43393674943363
<SOS> let  our  first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers <EOS> 589.9659759979836
<SOS> collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming  when she found herself so affectionately received <EOS> 307.7103235539304
<SOS> the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news  and telling again what had been already written  and when it closed  elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with her husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well <EOS> 251.36700157623378
<SOS> a lively imagination soon settled it all <EOS> 567.2709495660768
<SOS> elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing more  and down they ran into the dining room  which fronted the lane  in quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate <EOS> 456.5209482849325
<SOS> the other is misse bourgh <EOS> 462.7009781895942
<SOS> i like her appearance   said elizabeth  struck with other ideas <EOS> 356.4666512326202
<SOS> yes  she will do for him very well <EOS> 127.85885338927943
<SOS> she will make him a very proper wife <EOS> 194.2122263479707
<SOS> scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning  but their visit to rosings <EOS> 276.08631370890157
<SOS> i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest  there is no occasion for any thing more <EOS> 231.42606868168372
<SOS> elizabeth s courage did not fail her <EOS> 184.23573154559892
<SOS> she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money and rank  she thought she could witness without trepidation <EOS> 245.9936785337469
<SOS> he carved  and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was commended  first by him  and then by sir william  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said  in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear <EOS> 400.3637482624926
<SOS> jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little misse bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing she were indisposed <EOS> 819.2535036491698
<SOS> when the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted <EOS> 235.4916921291865
<SOS> collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she knew the least  and who she observed to mr <EOS> 304.51432218334
<SOS> one of them does <EOS> 214.3799034746009
<SOS> no  not at all <EOS> 114.1973114779352
<SOS> i never heard of such a thing <EOS> 93.58851630142671
<SOS> what  all five out at once <EOS> 432.2137745368781
<SOS> and you only the second <EOS> 119.42403076006647
<SOS> lady catherine  sir william  and mr and mr <EOS> 368.7845111900826
<SOS> the room in which the ladies sat was backwards <EOS> 156.38208473766844
<SOS> collins s joints of meat were too large for her family <EOS> 207.72722357525143
<SOS> their other engagements were few  as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general  was beyond the collinses  reach <EOS> 344.49536139627514
<SOS> her favourite walk  and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine  was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity <EOS> 376.76762390326013
<SOS> charlotte had seen them from her husband s room  crossing the road  and immediately running into the other  told the girls what an honour they might expect  adding   i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility <EOS> 462.0181403157617
<SOS> elizabeth merely curtseyed to him  without saying a word <EOS> 232.04769589491397
<SOS> it was some days  however  before they received any invitation thither  for while there were visitors in the house  they could not be necessary  and it was not till easter day  almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by such an attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening <EOS> 279.4008737201037
<SOS> collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much <EOS> 566.3377281699869
<SOS> i often tell young ladies  that no excellence in music is to be acquired  without constant practice <EOS> 530.2346774176947
<SOS> jenkinson s room <EOS> 420.957135880743
<SOS> my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me <EOS> 178.113818731139
<SOS> elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said to colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word i say <EOS> 296.28357966092886
<SOS> it is not that i do not believe  my  fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution <EOS> 173.59974095248327
<SOS> you have employed your time much better <EOS> 216.97901364778048
<SOS> no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you  can think any thing wanting <EOS> 261.4693690437359
<SOS> he has many friends  and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing <EOS> 282.94147659928285
<SOS> if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  for then we might possibly get a settled family there <EOS> 270.4739891793333
<SOS> she was afraid of talking longer of his friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him <EOS> 192.37704428148302
<SOS> lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford <EOS> 206.88713389217713
<SOS> i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages  of the match   cried elizabeth <EOS> 138.18809026116708
<SOS> as he spoke there was a sort of smile  which elizabeth fancied she understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield  and she blushed as she answered   i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family <EOS> 152.96037215590212
<SOS> the far and the near must be relative  and depend on many varying circumstances <EOS> 363.4962300062085
<SOS> the gentleman experienced some change of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the table  and  glancing over it  said  in a colder voice   are you pleased with kent <EOS> 405.4485345939149
<SOS> mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on missennet  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body  went away <EOS> 416.38514168792614
<SOS> what can be the meaning of this <EOS> 87.81513964501652
<SOS> within doors there was lady catherine  books  and a billiard table  but gentlemen cannot be always within doors  and in the nearness of the parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day <EOS> 297.86889685039455
<SOS> collins knew not what to make of him <EOS> 216.932303111154
<SOS> more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park  unexpectedly meet mr darcy <EOS> 425.4211140674985
<SOS> how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd <EOS> 302.3264222589057
<SOS> said she <EOS> 103.06258846509488
<SOS> it is only that he has better means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor <EOS> 312.0403050646854
<SOS> young ladies of her age  are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the true darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way <EOS> 266.6584933159385
<SOS> hurst and missingley <EOS> 295.5638330107948
<SOS> i think i have heard you say that you know them <EOS> 61.653388113269244
<SOS> it was all conjecture <EOS> 137.10925581742643
<SOS> elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with indignation <EOS> 223.92232126328707
<SOS> there  shut into her own room  as soon as their visitor left them  she could think without interruption of all that she had heard <EOS> 169.39599505512066
<SOS> there were some very strong objections against the lady   were colonel fitzwilliam s words  and these strong objections probably were  her having one uncle who was a country attorney  and another who was in business in london <EOS> 471.782623963987
<SOS> they contained no actual complaint  nor was there any revival of past occurrences  or any communication of present suffering <EOS> 453.6731260009137
<SOS> while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once before called late in the evening  and might now come to enquire particularly after her <EOS> 266.6133736399308
<SOS> you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you <EOS> 219.88997165265354
<SOS> he spoke well  but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed  and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride <EOS> 172.08834147155665
<SOS> she tried  however  to compose herself to answer him with patience  when he should have done <EOS> 201.52066081426423
<SOS> but i cannot  i have never desired your good opinion  and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly <EOS> 197.673976654384
<SOS> i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one <EOS> 132.799833073772
<SOS> was not this some excuse for incivility  if i  was  uncivil <EOS> 325.0858881210538
<SOS> as she pronounced these words  mr darcy changed colour  but the emotion was short  and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued <EOS> 417.79329314386365
<SOS> long before it had taken place  my opinion of you was decided <EOS> 256.716019329162
<SOS> repeated darcy contemptuously   yes  his misfortunes have been great indeed <EOS> 609.3093468762398
<SOS> but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence <EOS> 443.44575213473166
<SOS> elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said   you are mistaken  mr darcy  if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you  had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner <EOS> 269.465309055121
<SOS> she went on <EOS> 148.3273695281937
<SOS> the tumult of her mind was now painfully great <EOS> 162.89430600519265
<SOS> chapter xii <EOS> 685.149442775185
<SOS> you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand your      attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but i      demand it of your justice <EOS> 334.2569073975411
<SOS> at that      ball  while i had the honour of dancing with you  i was first made      acquainted  by sir william lucas s accidental information  that      bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage <EOS> 310.40982312006116
<SOS> your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable <EOS> 291.591207913926
<SOS> i will only say farther  that      from what passed that evening  my opinion of all parties was      confirmed  and every inducement heightened  which could have led me      before  to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy      connection <EOS> 310.76855041146376
<SOS> i described  and      enforced them earnestly <EOS> 365.37368687016135
<SOS> but  however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination  i do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been      seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving  of your      sister s indifference <EOS> 131.30794596983642
<SOS> he had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere  if not with equal regard <EOS> 433.19359995018726
<SOS> to persuade him against      returning into hertfordshire  when that conviction had been given       was scarcely the work of a moment <EOS> 370.06968996815516
<SOS> if i have wounded your sister s      feelings  it was unknowingly done  and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient  i have      not yet learnt to condemn them <EOS> 235.0095032700725
<SOS> with respect to that other  more      weighty accusation  of having injured mr wickham  i can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family <EOS> 163.3888887753017
<SOS> as for myself  it is many  many years since i first began to think      of him in a very different manner <EOS> 179.62244871713705
<SOS> it adds even another motive <EOS> 1282.4760302217462
<SOS> the business was therefore soon settled <EOS> 321.71765377467375
<SOS> all connection between us seemed now dissolved <EOS> 535.6468069701212
<SOS> i      thought too ill of him  to invite him to pemberley  or admit his      society in town <EOS> 243.415408880867
<SOS> in town i believe he chiefly lived  but his      studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free from all      restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation <EOS> 304.0353531520731
<SOS> for      about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation <EOS> 143.88437158350544
<SOS> about a year ago  she was taken from      school  and an establishment formed for her in london  and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it  to ramsgate       and thither also went mr wickham  undoubtedly by design  for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mr <EOS> 358.83622620835496
<SOS> she was then but      fifteen  which must be her excuse  and after stating her      imprudence  i am happy to add  that i owed the knowledge of it to      herself <EOS> 197.53916300599897
<SOS> his revenge would have been complete indeed <EOS> 258.2737135981911
<SOS> this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards mr wickham <EOS> 219.41984084115933
<SOS> ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either  detection could not be in your power  and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination <EOS> 413.67074121332877
<SOS> but such as they were  it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them  and what a contrariety of emotion they excited <EOS> 235.10369826073585
<SOS> he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her  his style was not penitent  but haughty <EOS> 205.2615580382212
<SOS> what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that her wishes did not err <EOS> 207.41073500645226
<SOS> after pausing on this point a considerable while  she once more continued to read <EOS> 483.4848338289382
<SOS> the story which followed of his designs on missarcy  received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself  from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs  and whose character she had no reason to question <EOS> 256.78475178941727
<SOS> she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself  in their first evening at mr philips s <EOS> 257.6098316076577
<SOS> she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy  that mr darcy might leave the country  but that  he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week <EOS> 195.1259337144959
<SOS> but vanity  not love  has been my folly <EOS> 412.4587248793194
<SOS> pleased with the preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either were concerned <EOS> 335.3195165894507
<SOS> neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane <EOS> 221.17835694231823
<SOS> elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in missing him  she really rejoiced at it <EOS> 559.3781181989054

<SOS> but i am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be so much attached to me <EOS> 155.07601991231735
<SOS> but so they always are <EOS> 317.61487517186794
<SOS> mr collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here  which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter <EOS> 205.77819413980578
<SOS> i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation   replied elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it <EOS> 133.10442826475503
<SOS> i expected you to stay two months <EOS> 481.0754884960615
<SOS> there can be no occasion for your going so soon <EOS> 148.9685048139344
<SOS> bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight <EOS> 880.2114962404019
<SOS> and if you will stay another  month  complete  it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london  for i am going there early in june  for a week  and as dawson does not object to the barouche box  there will be very good room for one of you  and indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i should not object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large <EOS> 165.64890561446862
<SOS> collins  you must send a servant with them <EOS> 283.48077778086196
<SOS> my uncle is to send a servant for us <EOS> 261.1761725718901
<SOS> he keeps a man servant  does he <EOS> 574.2970312246832
<SOS> elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia  but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence  what chance could there be of improvement <EOS> 294.4645152674321
<SOS> chapter xv <EOS> 640.648855007432
<SOS> on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared  and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary <EOS> 301.7176333953707
<SOS> our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast <EOS> 551.1286831203346
<SOS> collins you have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate  but on this point it will be as well to be silent <EOS> 203.41633197503305
<SOS> he then handed her in  maria followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  when he suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings <EOS> 210.23971383730162
<SOS> it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn  before she told her sister of mr darcy s proposals <EOS> 144.265937006349
<SOS> it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street  for the town of      in hertfordshire  and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet s carriage was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in token of the coachman s punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs <EOS> 314.52626779344456
<SOS> is not this an agreeable surprise <EOS> 367.61647550149956
<SOS> yes   thought elizabeth    that  would be a delightful scheme  indeed  and completely do for us at once <EOS> 306.4081219267401
<SOS> i am glad he is gone <EOS> 130.41943987250798
<SOS> there s for you <EOS> 123.62663645841927
<SOS> i am glad i bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox <EOS> 151.4540480204039
<SOS> kitty and me were to spend the day there  and mr <EOS> 193.66768483015844
<SOS> how i laughed <EOS> 299.4737443158863
<SOS> i thought i should have died <EOS> 135.8545575798483
<SOS> their party in the dining room was large  for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were the subjects which occupied them  lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  mr <EOS> 448.5028757567233
<SOS> i was ready to die of laughter <EOS> 301.8482016697894
<SOS> to this  mary very gravely replied   far be it from me  my dear sister  to depreciate such pleasures <EOS> 304.3303000954676
<SOS> but i confess they would have no charms for  me <EOS> 126.11387938012072
<SOS> in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on  but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme <EOS> 275.66346838489227
<SOS> elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome  and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing her to be surprised  she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself <EOS> 210.1422655840283
<SOS> but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham <EOS> 292.6007136376365
<SOS> who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind  as was here collected in one individual <EOS> 323.0858972220413
<SOS> nor was darcy s vindication  though grateful to her feelings  capable of consoling her for such discovery <EOS> 525.8749907106971
<SOS> there is but such a quantity of merit between them  just enough to make one good sort of man  and of late it has been shifting about pretty much <EOS> 194.7964379894614
<SOS> i do not know when i have been more shocked   said she <EOS> 68.6638283529906
<SOS> i know you will do him such ample justice  that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent <EOS> 237.1982790231167
<SOS> poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance <EOS> 216.53417316083429
<SOS> to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever <EOS> 453.7147041266387
<SOS> she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy s letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend <EOS> 161.82505734073155
<SOS> jane was not happy <EOS> 151.98981709949382
<SOS> well  lizzy   said mr <EOS> 447.06484481491196
<SOS> there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer  and i have enquired of every body too  who is likely to know <EOS> 148.86851424332153
<SOS> nobody wants him to come <EOS> 517.0258409352435
<SOS> yes  yes <EOS> 392.778367150622
<SOS> they look upon it quite as their own  i dare say  whenever that happens <EOS> 495.41057447713814
<SOS> forster  the wife of the colonel of the regiment  to accompany her to brighton <EOS> 224.19260582273077
<SOS> a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of their  three  months  acquaintance they had been intimate  two <EOS> 299.1653928391766
<SOS> the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mr <EOS> 157.71704447266416
<SOS> forster should not ask  me  as well as lydia   said she   though i am  not  her particular friend <EOS> 174.47821263405115
<SOS> in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to make her resigned <EOS> 166.80435130874272
<SOS> as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia  that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter  and detestable as such a step must make her were it known  she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go <EOS> 175.19398938888804
<SOS> if you were aware   said elizabeth   of the very great disadvantage to us all  which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner  nay  which has already arisen from it  i am sure you would judge differently in the affair <EOS> 290.9541240478119
<SOS> her character will be fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous <EOS> 354.39613934119143
<SOS> in this danger kitty is also comprehended <EOS> 657.9466491700781
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> the officers will find women better worth their notice <EOS> 1097.987084769934
<SOS> let us hope  therefore  that her being there may teach her her own insignificance <EOS> 422.27868524406125
<SOS> with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own opinion continued the same  and she left him disappointed and sorry <EOS> 181.17357112622753
<SOS> she was confident of having performed her duty  and to fret over unavoidable evils  or augment them by anxiety  was no part of her disposition <EOS> 252.7968303971738
<SOS> in lydia s imagination  a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness <EOS> 393.40957731901653
<SOS> having been frequently in company with him since her return  agitation was pretty well over  the agitations of former partiality entirely so <EOS> 419.32519587543806
<SOS> yes  very different <EOS> 412.91736177792717
<SOS> but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance <EOS> 185.33775327721557
<SOS> and pray may i ask <EOS> 388.21145086304966
<SOS> oh  no <EOS> 200.8092052920246
<SOS> while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning <EOS> 753.7769688822373
<SOS> elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head <EOS> 152.85177504605068
<SOS> when the party broke up  lydia returned with mr <EOS> 586.253144599597
<SOS> kitty was the only one who shed tears  but she did weep from vexation and envy <EOS> 237.21788873169572
<SOS> had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort <EOS> 329.2194372796903
<SOS> upon the whole  therefore  she found  what has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire  did not in taking place  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself <EOS> 364.16320637758133
<SOS> were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment would be certain <EOS> 388.87645767436413
<SOS> when lydia went away  she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always long expected  and always very short <EOS> 278.4521584904901
<SOS> bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity  and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope  that by the following christmas  she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day  unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office  another regiment should be quartered in meryton <EOS> 374.97724094627307
<SOS> the period of expectation was now doubled <EOS> 142.24998919543327
<SOS> one enjoyment was certain  that of suitableness as companions  a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences  cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure  and affection and intelligence  which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad <EOS> 581.2722008026575
<SOS> to the little town of lambton  the scene of mr <EOS> 195.91180275263355
<SOS> she felt that she had no business at pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it <EOS> 186.38050401603206
<SOS> she blushed at the very idea  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt  than to run such a risk <EOS> 174.0378658575107
<SOS> egerton  military library  whitehall <EOS> 3379.0745561503436
<SOS> elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length they turned in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter <EOS> 408.51093466952625
<SOS> they gradually ascended for half a mile  and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house  situated on the opposite side of a valley  into which the road with some abruptness wound <EOS> 372.4482539330472
<SOS> every disposition of the ground was good  and she looked on the whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its banks  and the winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  with delight <EOS> 221.53131609718406
<SOS> instead of viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt <EOS> 263.2300084514214
<SOS> how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day <EOS> 341.66812399426533
<SOS> the housekeeper came forward  and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman  the son of her late master s steward  who had been brought up by him at his own expence <EOS> 185.8344461317348
<SOS> i am sure  i  know none so handsome  but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this <EOS> 232.81385326875295
<SOS> reynolds then directed their attention to one of missarcy  drawn when she was only eight years old <EOS> 527.1161118172282
<SOS> yes  the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so accomplished <EOS> 416.5131846708444
<SOS> yes  sir  but i do not know when  that  will be <EOS> 94.59763848694269
<SOS> gardiner smiled <EOS> 679.9994468737327
<SOS> elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for more <EOS> 581.7477000012501
<SOS> there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name <EOS> 181.6840182177533
<SOS> reynolds anticipated missarcy s delight  when she should enter the room <EOS> 579.2410804061233
<SOS> how much of good or evil must be done by him <EOS> 264.00428422798166
<SOS> he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced towards the party  and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of perfect composure  at least of perfect civility <EOS> 596.6716210165714
<SOS> they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece  who  astonished and confused  scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family <EOS> 434.4129093791623
<SOS> amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted  every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there  recurring to her mind  the few minutes in which they continued together  were some of the most uncomfortable of her life <EOS> 294.25645522827756
<SOS> she was overpowered by shame and vexation <EOS> 248.98595183347553
<SOS> it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again <EOS> 266.26697897559734
<SOS> or  why did he thus come a day before he was expected <EOS> 317.2112402279468
<SOS> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water  and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and  though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out  she distinguished no part of the scene <EOS> 177.97239345540427
<SOS> her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house  whichever it might be  where mr darcy then was <EOS> 298.8331688225798
<SOS> with a triumphant smile  they were told  that it was ten miles round <EOS> 279.12869243072225
<SOS> what will be his surprise   thought she   when he knows who they are <EOS> 252.938227932711
<SOS> she listened most attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his intelligence  his taste  or his good manners <EOS> 323.61407438893764
<SOS> after a short silence  the lady first spoke <EOS> 458.9600678824526
<SOS> she immediately felt that whatever desire missarcy might have of being acquainted with her  must be the work of her brother  and without looking farther  it was satisfactory  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her <EOS> 238.79720711734294
<SOS> they soon outstripped the others  and when they had reached the carriage  mr and mr <EOS> 198.87203321279648
<SOS> gardiner s coming up  they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined  and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness <EOS> 351.5308536051105
<SOS> mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off  elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house <EOS> 323.8656338744737
<SOS> i can now say with the housekeeper  that though some people may call him proud   i  have seen nothing of it <EOS> 211.26658295864604
<SOS> his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling <EOS> 203.49188316461886
<SOS> she was less handsome than her brother  but there was sense and good humour in her face  and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle <EOS> 207.4559987185068
<SOS> of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough <EOS> 260.49055367619013
<SOS> how ardently did she long to know  whether any of his were directed in a like manner <EOS> 304.9919179151929
<SOS> he observed to her  at a moment when the others were talking together  and in a tone which had something of real regret  that it  was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her   and  before she could reply  he added   it is above eight months <EOS> 186.67708797729532
<SOS> their visitors staid with them above half an hour  and when they arose to depart  mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mr <EOS> 289.35586045338124
<SOS> eager to be alone  and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt  she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress <EOS> 306.06650209089173
<SOS> it had been settled in the evening  between the aunt and niece  that such a striking civility as missarcy s  in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had reached it only to a late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though it could not be equalled  by some exertion of politeness on their side  and  consequently  that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning <EOS> 150.5655037875497
<SOS> they were  therefore  to go <EOS> 148.1134146650292
<SOS> chapter iii <EOS> 607.370025583388
<SOS> convinced as elizabeth now was that missingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side  the acquaintance would now be renewed <EOS> 306.8491300413837
<SOS> gardiner and her niece  however  did her justice  and pitied her <EOS> 255.32653265207242
<SOS> it was first broken by mr <EOS> 264.6865157808446
<SOS> annesley  a genteel  agreeable looking woman  whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse  proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others  and between her and mr <EOS> 616.1800419633007
<SOS> they must be a great loss to  your  family <EOS> 114.82729245639236
<SOS> their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned  and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage  missingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person  behaviour  and dress <EOS> 259.5277739058449
<SOS> for my own part   she rejoined   i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her <EOS> 126.96452842328834
<SOS> i should as soon call her mother a wit <EOS> 296.11703372766317
<SOS> gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject <EOS> 280.4396714212043
<SOS> they were off saturday night about twelve  as      is conjectured  but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight <EOS> 933.7076414366976
<SOS> the express was sent off directly <EOS> 504.66355195748685
<SOS> colonel forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon <EOS> 883.8672694471794
<SOS> lydia left a few lines for his wife       informing her of their intention <EOS> 355.6154435856709
<SOS> imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia      would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place  for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland <EOS> 272.70118222687745
<SOS> colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton the day      before  not many hours after the express <EOS> 705.0976082795422
<SOS> he did trace them easily to      clapham  but no farther  for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from epsom <EOS> 594.9522262673428
<SOS> all that is known after this is  that they were seen      to continue the london road <EOS> 273.4500988036925
<SOS> i know not what to think <EOS> 74.26938020273806
<SOS> with the kindest concern he      came on to longbourn  and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart <EOS> 184.3806996128103
<SOS> i am sincerely grieved for him and      mr <EOS> 156.21473809145846
<SOS> i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes  but now as the first shock      is over  shall i own that i long for your return <EOS> 364.9880160652039
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> cried elizabeth  darting from her seat as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him  without losing a moment of the time so precious  but as she reached the door  it was opened by a servant  and mr darcy appeared <EOS> 158.9883767342778
<SOS> calling back the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to fetch his master and mistress home  instantly <EOS> 466.81491293139106
<SOS> i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn <EOS> 265.50922263041747
<SOS> at length  she spoke again <EOS> 311.26443371517627
<SOS> they are gone off together from brighton <EOS> 609.8152762850489
<SOS> had i but explained some part of it only  some part of what i learnt  to my own family <EOS> 186.1366613746228
<SOS> had his character been known  this could not have happened <EOS> 284.5422552871843
<SOS> but it is all  all too late now <EOS> 133.6620689460655
<SOS> they left brighton together on sunday night  and were traced almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not gone to scotland <EOS> 693.3598705290547
<SOS> my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in half an hour <EOS> 233.0205231230545

<SOS> darcy made no answer <EOS> 398.98739623521317
<SOS> lydia  the humiliation  the misery  she was bringing on them all  soon swallowed up every private care  and covering her face with her handkerchief  elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else  and  after a pause of several minutes  was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion  who  in a manner  which though it spoke compassion  spoke likewise restraint  said   i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence  nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay  but real  though unavailing  concern <EOS> 312.6072876933136
<SOS> but now it was all too natural <EOS> 150.7786789458294
<SOS> the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl <EOS> 429.4061239715021
<SOS> how acutely did she now feel it <EOS> 411.79995869710365
<SOS> gardiner had hurried back in alarm  supposing  by the servant s account  that their niece was taken suddenly ill   but satisfying them instantly on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the postscript of the last  with trembling energy <EOS> 431.79029394580175
<SOS> but wishes were vain  or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour <EOS> 392.189531947027
<SOS> an hour  however  saw the whole completed  and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn  nothing remained to be done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of the morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to longbourn <EOS> 208.69225642717413
<SOS> but of every other neglect i can believe him capable <EOS> 318.4094738872402
<SOS> why should they not go on to scotland  if that had been the case <EOS> 267.8664507322949
<SOS> wickham will never marry a woman without some money <EOS> 453.5344925142566
<SOS> but  really  i know not what to say <EOS> 130.49101125662972
<SOS> since the     shire were first quartered in meryton  nothing but love  flirtation  and officers  have been in her head <EOS> 473.4786696218539
<SOS> and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman <EOS> 201.28687165678147
<SOS> and who is there  whatever might be their former conduct  that she would believe capable of such an attempt  till it were proved against them <EOS> 350.9961033846784
<SOS> i told you the other day  of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy  and you  yourself  when last at longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke of the man  who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him <EOS> 184.40472505004922
<SOS> as that was the case  neither jane  to whom i related the whole  nor i  thought it necessary to make our knowledge public  for of what use could it apparently be to any one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him  should then be overthrown <EOS> 325.0790682037385
<SOS> that  she  could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head <EOS> 181.83127177765758
<SOS> that such a consequence as  this  should ensue  you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts <EOS> 281.967592012109
<SOS> yes  he went on tuesday as i wrote you word <EOS> 299.5273575028888
<SOS> my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are greatly shaken <EOS> 546.8855124543128
<SOS> jane ran to her uncle and aunt  and welcomed and thanked them both  with alternate smiles and tears <EOS> 274.19297312294833
<SOS> when they were all in the drawing room  the questions which elizabeth had already asked  were of course repeated by the others  and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give <EOS> 173.41072340845275
<SOS> i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her  but i was over ruled  as i always am <EOS> 128.39580805985108
<SOS> bennet   that is exactly what i could most wish for <EOS> 209.47859430443356
<SOS> as for mary  she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table   this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much talked of <EOS> 351.0826800099005
<SOS> what did colonel forster say <EOS> 676.1596521153735
<SOS> they must have seen them together for ever <EOS> 184.38670725481936
<SOS> colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality  especially on lydia s side  but nothing to give him any alarm <EOS> 410.01668071916146
<SOS> and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you entertained a doubt  i suppose  of their being really married <EOS> 437.11387135570294
<SOS> how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains <EOS> 363.55749673764063
<SOS> but not before they went to brighton <EOS> 275.60296054061945
<SOS> i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did <EOS> 150.05639198555158
<SOS> oh <EOS> 288.6099884625897
<SOS> he could not speak a word for full ten minutes <EOS> 328.3468965919786
<SOS> you do not look well <EOS> 135.79689724325783
<SOS> bennet  and was a great comfort to them  in their hours of freedom <EOS> 195.93552185775937
<SOS> she had never heard of his having had any relations  except a father and mother  both of whom had been dead many years <EOS> 310.98875557831275
<SOS> it was possible  however  that some of his companions in the     shire  might be able to give more information  and  though she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application was a something to look forward to <EOS> 174.49561377966376
<SOS> be assured  my dear sir  that mr <EOS> 427.0279550877774
<SOS> it was not known that wickham had a single relation  with whom he kept up any connection  and it was certain that he had no near one living <EOS> 156.77179673910052
<SOS> and in the wretched state of his own finances  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy  in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations  for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him  to a very considerable amount <EOS> 157.18538872174193
<SOS> this is wholly unexpected <EOS> 566.2042764450908
<SOS> as mr <EOS> 217.42200085022287
<SOS> mr <EOS> 427.7687657926
<SOS> it has been my own doing  and i ought to feel it <EOS> 122.92183835329647
<SOS> you must not be too severe upon yourself   replied elizabeth <EOS> 246.80722500926822
<SOS> they were interrupted by missennet  who came to fetch her mother s tea <EOS> 264.62225624567697
<SOS> i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds <EOS> 230.84826928115876
<SOS> dear madam   cried mr <EOS> 1207.6378251393
<SOS> good or bad <EOS> 606.2166523993542
<SOS> these are conditions  which       considering every thing  i had no hesitation in complying with  as      far as i thought myself privileged  for you <EOS> 245.03224132171044
<SOS> we have judged it best  that my      niece should be married from this house  of which i hope you will      approve <EOS> 201.0221094693871
<SOS> your s   c <EOS> 449.951318031545
<SOS> and have you answered the letter <EOS> 253.05636520401248
<SOS> no  but it must be done soon <EOS> 159.58470820007287
<SOS> and so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the house <EOS> 247.96927256592096
<SOS> how is half such a sum to be repaid <EOS> 213.72011045232236
<SOS> mary and kitty were both with mr <EOS> 410.5381131854939
<SOS> after a slight preparation for good news  the letter was read aloud <EOS> 312.8052872921987
<SOS> as soon as jane had read mr gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married  her joy burst forth  and every following sentence added to its exuberance <EOS> 272.7441838357647
<SOS> she will be married at sixteen <EOS> 186.90187977521788
<SOS> and to see dear wickham too <EOS> 195.86415367693755
<SOS> lizzy  my dear  run down to your father  and ask him how much he will give her <EOS> 172.21307817804728
<SOS> we will settle with your father about the money afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately <EOS> 339.9304941431424
<SOS> and as i come back  i can call on lady lucas and mr <EOS> 303.23501144913604
<SOS> had he done his duty in that respect  lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle  for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her <EOS> 217.82189313008956
<SOS> this was one point  with regard to lydia at least  which was now to be settled  and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him <EOS> 139.52241291543342
<SOS> he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser  by the hundred that was to be paid them  for  what with her board and pocket allowance  and the continual presents in money  which passed to her  through her mother s hands  lydia s expences had been very little within that sum <EOS> 246.75913663416117
<SOS> i will not encourage the impudence of either  by receiving them at longbourn <EOS> 213.9703977793693
<SOS> she was convinced that she could have been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they should meet <EOS> 109.53248450322953
<SOS> she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man  who  in disposition and talents  would most suit her <EOS> 225.78274000799067
<SOS> an union of a different tendency  and precluding the possibility of the other  was soon to be formed in their family <EOS> 145.52440743770538
<SOS> but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue  she could easily conjecture <EOS> 416.7100607071321
<SOS> it is mr wickham s intention to go      into the regulars  and  among his former friends  there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army <EOS> 241.6641444255424
<SOS> haggerston has our directions  and      all will be completed in a week <EOS> 514.1522072132126
<SOS> lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown open  and she ran into the room <EOS> 241.67257065465344
<SOS> wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his manners were always so pleasing  that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy address  while he claimed their relationship  would have delighted them all <EOS> 331.7852880444769
<SOS> though i thought it would be very good fun if i was <EOS> 75.41122433391575
<SOS> i only hope they may have half my good luck <EOS> 296.2510185983273
<SOS> that is the place to get husbands <EOS> 251.4408697124997
<SOS> are not you curious to hear how it was managed <EOS> 142.21844228571936
<SOS> and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock <EOS> 220.7111861139408
<SOS> i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat <EOS> 173.58514321007345
<SOS> conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and wild  hurried into her brain  but she was satisfied with none <EOS> 296.2504556852429
<SOS> those that best pleased her  as placing his conduct in the noblest light  seemed most improbable <EOS> 542.1014804924025
<SOS> jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  elizabeth was glad of it   till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante <EOS> 385.97187659462753

<SOS> if you do not choose to understand me  forgive my      impertinence <EOS> 201.8803188118029
<SOS> he came to tell mr gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were  and that      he had seen and talked with them both  wickham repeatedly  lydia      once <EOS> 158.76009368576754
<SOS> his character      was to speak for itself <EOS> 258.5678507615765
<SOS> he had been some days in town  before he was able to      discover them  but he had something to direct his search  which was      more than  we  had  and the consciousness of this  was another      reason for his resolving to follow us <EOS> 169.6344549519028
<SOS> there is a lady  it seems  a      mr <EOS> 395.8094290331185
<SOS> wickham indeed had gone to her  on their first arrival in      london  and had she been able to receive them into her house  they      would have taken up their abode with her <EOS> 206.33830023751375
<SOS> she cared for none      of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not hear of      leaving wickham <EOS> 266.2312182681701
<SOS> mr darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once <EOS> 115.45236064793477
<SOS> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle  and therefore readily postponed      seeing him  till after the departure of the former <EOS> 183.54816916484097
<SOS> nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself  though i am sure  and i do      not speak it to be thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole <EOS> 149.69696230261957
<SOS> i believe i have now told you every thing <EOS> 121.13648866158515
<SOS> lydia came to      us  and wickham had constant admission to the house <EOS> 134.50087826164864
<SOS> he  was      exactly what he had been  when i knew him in hertfordshire  but i      would not tell you how little i was satisfied with  her  behaviour      while she staid with us  if i had not perceived  by jane s letter      last wednesday  that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it  and therefore what i now tell you  can give you no      fresh pain <EOS> 194.9845005877255
<SOS> mr darcy was      punctual in his return  and as lydia informed you  attended the      wedding <EOS> 164.4648588954253
<SOS> he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem <EOS> 357.5468950592437
<SOS> he had to be sure done much <EOS> 100.73675293273142
<SOS> it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it  and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement  she could  perhaps  believe  that remaining partiality for her  might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned <EOS> 279.64679497550856
<SOS> true <EOS> 613.8001031590641
<SOS> i almost envy you the pleasure  and yet i believe it would be too much for me  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle <EOS> 176.89690133796645
<SOS> elizabeth hoped she had silenced him  but he soon afterwards said   i was surprised to see darcy in town last month <EOS> 192.10342873192437
<SOS> perhaps preparing for his marriage with misse bourgh   said elizabeth <EOS> 449.54234510427494
<SOS> it must be something particular  to take him there at this time of year <EOS> 205.77387576467711
<SOS> i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had <EOS> 109.32848106227051

<SOS> i mention it  because it is the living which i ought to have had <EOS> 113.8771357039322
<SOS> one ought not to repine   but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing for me <EOS> 105.51751221153962
<SOS> do not let us quarrel about the past <EOS> 555.9653974704399
<SOS> mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation  that he never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear sister elizabeth  by introducing the subject of it  and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet <EOS> 178.40648924607603
<SOS> bennet was forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle  was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth <EOS> 292.0490585235503

<SOS> elizabeth did not know what to make of it <EOS> 94.41395346252936
<SOS> yet it is hard   she sometimes thought   that this poor man cannot come to a house  which he has legally hired  without raising all this speculation <EOS> 231.74622079433487
<SOS> in spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be her feelings  in the expectation of his arrival  elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it <EOS> 185.95863451841421
<SOS> long and the gouldings soon <EOS> 230.22388331515697

<SOS> mr bingley arrived <EOS> 218.3339272495856
<SOS> but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire  she saw him from her dressing room window  enter the paddock  and ride towards the house <EOS> 297.8158517358757

<SOS> gardiner s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him <EOS> 347.4975942391583
<SOS> her astonishment at his coming  at his coming to netherfield  to longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire <EOS> 267.5236789319902
<SOS> the colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half a minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes  as she thought for that space of time  that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken <EOS> 221.75157685788253
<SOS> it was a painful  but not an improbable  conjecture <EOS> 274.0750803889962
<SOS> a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood  since you went away <EOS> 345.4223833869242
<SOS> his regiment is there  for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the     shire  and of his being gone into the regulars <EOS> 172.66246267980912
<SOS> were the same fair prospect to arise at present  as had flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion <EOS> 356.84505843384073
<SOS> jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever <EOS> 188.13569753341548
<SOS> if he no longer cares for me  why silent <EOS> 516.1795511912941

<SOS> there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings <EOS> 103.11808091331145
<SOS> annesley is with her <EOS> 160.3481323271655
<SOS> he stood by her  however  for some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again  he walked away <EOS> 300.906149669289
<SOS> they were confined for the evening at different tables  and she had nothing to hope  but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room  as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself <EOS> 139.74026308476022
<SOS> the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw <EOS> 400.10068909497625

<SOS> forgive me  and if you persist in indifference  do not make  me  your confidante <EOS> 321.3915705362462
<SOS> his friend had left him that morning for london  but was to return home in ten days time <EOS> 367.24192683484415
<SOS> bennet invited him to dine with them  but  with many expressions of concern  he confessed himself engaged elsewhere <EOS> 478.32204856558894
<SOS> she then sat still five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious occasion  she suddenly got up  and saying to kitty   come here  my love  i want to speak to you   took her out of the room <EOS> 412.8864145088492
<SOS> he is gone to my father already <EOS> 149.24419086683153
<SOS> she will be down in a moment i dare say <EOS> 132.3064784188585
<SOS> it was an evening of no common delight to them all  the satisfaction of missennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face  as made her look handsomer than ever <EOS> 249.7988149988975
<SOS> imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters  would be unpardonable in  me <EOS> 465.36199653935165

<SOS> i remember  as soon as ever i saw him  when he first came into hertfordshire last year  i thought how likely it was that you should come together <EOS> 311.80759325875226
<SOS> at that moment  she cared for no other <EOS> 167.5617568899176

<SOS> bennet all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness <EOS> 539.8086757618978
<SOS> i should be glad to take a turn in it  if you will favour me with your company <EOS> 110.98742714213415
<SOS> how could i ever think her like her nephew <EOS> 293.9185807134238
<SOS> indeed  you are mistaken  madam <EOS> 596.5591530920209
<SOS> i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here <EOS> 106.22801361509113
<SOS> i was told  that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married  but that  you   that misslizabeth bennet  would  in all likelihood  be soon afterwards united to my nephew  my own nephew  mr darcy <EOS> 255.1689397057417
<SOS> missennet  i insist on being satisfied <EOS> 609.0525987605195
<SOS> now what have you to say <EOS> 182.97916282757564
<SOS> lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied   the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind <EOS> 311.8111455265504
<SOS> it was the favourite wish of  his  mother  as well as of her s <EOS> 80.70877179556481
<SOS> obstinate  headstrong girl <EOS> 2335.463635950485
<SOS> i am ashamed of you <EOS> 60.72701793919175
<SOS> they are descended on the maternal side  from the same noble line  and  on the father s  from respectable  honourable  and ancient  though untitled families <EOS> 317.2822478490541
<SOS> in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere <EOS> 473.72081309715685
<SOS> you  are  a gentleman s daughter <EOS> 159.34440506548722
<SOS> who are your uncles and aunts <EOS> 183.1638360053779
<SOS> tell me once for all  are you engaged to him <EOS> 367.2592117819506
<SOS> missennet i am shocked and astonished <EOS> 308.8076670976014
<SOS> but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede <EOS> 224.04741427980417
<SOS> i shall not go away  till you have given me the assurance i require <EOS> 201.26655829051705
<SOS> allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application  have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged <EOS> 346.0318418210868
<SOS> i have by no means done <EOS> 148.8457440437904
<SOS> and is  such  a girl to be my nephew s sister <EOS> 123.11021577801102
<SOS> she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs <EOS> 495.34946561480507
<SOS> i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you  lizzy <EOS> 211.08415333626422
<SOS> he then said   i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly <EOS> 251.31153835037188
<SOS> from mr collins <EOS> 84.27395222999458
<SOS> and what can  he  have to say <EOS> 134.2102498049963
<SOS> what relates to yourself  is as follows <EOS> 533.7454649994531
<SOS> yet in spite of all these temptations  let me warn my cousin elizabeth  and yourself  of what evils you may incur  by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals  which  of course  you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of <EOS> 287.07211013714857
<SOS> mr darcy  who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish  and who probably never looked at  you  in his life <EOS> 126.24548339989751
<SOS> it is admirable <EOS> 179.8886523335882
<SOS> elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could only force one most reluctant smile <EOS> 416.9435707467233
<SOS> i must not  however  neglect the duties of my station  or refrain from declaring my amazement  at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married <EOS> 242.98283310913735
<SOS> it was an encouragement of vice  and had i been the rector of longbourn  i should very strenuously have opposed it <EOS> 185.67828798861206
<SOS> for what do we live  but to make sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our turn <EOS> 363.77545000013794
<SOS> and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine about this report <EOS> 380.10361753476025
<SOS> did she call to refuse her consent <EOS> 314.8783596275562
<SOS> chapter xvi <EOS> 645.6566699806539
<SOS> it was agreed to <EOS> 77.25004266121799
<SOS> bennet was not in the habit of walking  mary could never spare time  but the remaining five set off together <EOS> 433.9215665532105
<SOS> i am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied darcy  in a tone of surprise and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what may  in a mistaken light  have given you uneasiness <EOS> 275.5017821534629
<SOS> you must not blame my aunt <EOS> 171.84344436654638
<SOS> my  affections and wishes are unchanged  but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever <EOS> 246.51608896538727
<SOS> it taught me to hope   said he   as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before <EOS> 205.15834310402494
<SOS> for  though your accusations were ill founded  formed on mistaken premises  my behaviour to you at the time  had merited the severest reproof <EOS> 360.1455567642992
<SOS> the conduct of neither  if strictly examined  will be irreproachable  but since then  we have both  i hope  improved in civility <EOS> 444.87162984940545
<SOS> your reproof  so well applied  i shall never forget   had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner <EOS> 450.40497859772245
<SOS> i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way <EOS> 132.24429915015804
<SOS> you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling  i am sure you did <EOS> 134.74819869179265
<SOS> there was one part especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your having the power of reading again <EOS> 224.28938351313988
<SOS> when i wrote that letter   replied darcy   i believed myself perfectly calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit <EOS> 386.88566936821024
<SOS> but think no more of the letter <EOS> 148.52803789016113
<SOS> i was given good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit <EOS> 229.3653581639919
<SOS> you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased <EOS> 514.2815858835936
<SOS> i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began to take a proper direction <EOS> 415.57441476314983
<SOS> he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister  had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there  had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend <EOS> 267.45981558683843
<SOS> darcy was delighted with their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest information of it <EOS> 228.5490679587214
<SOS> on the evening before my going to london   said he  i made a confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago <EOS> 199.3890664762206
<SOS> he had never had the slightest suspicion <EOS> 234.23224115708487
<SOS> and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate conviction to him <EOS> 414.9493372184083
<SOS> he was angry <EOS> 192.37620722403088
<SOS> chapter xvii <EOS> 632.5447064692017
<SOS> the evening passed quietly  unmarked by any thing extraordinary <EOS> 401.8118338582617
<SOS> but are you pleased  jane <EOS> 242.72936683107994
<SOS> very  very much <EOS> 189.41315337069003
<SOS> nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight <EOS> 863.4518784732156
<SOS> let me know every thing that i am to know  without delay <EOS> 187.6277944322669
<SOS> were it for nothing but his love of you  i must always have esteemed him  but now  as bingley s friend and your husband  there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me <EOS> 160.18946917636467
<SOS> i owe all that i know of it  to another  not to you <EOS> 97.85278405002758
<SOS> as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good information  and he soon afterwards said aloud   mr bennet  have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day <EOS> 308.97827811294593
<SOS> i advise mr darcy  and lizzy  and kitty   said mr <EOS> 179.94921042609954
<SOS> bennet   to walk to oakham mount this morning <EOS> 376.5508380906406
<SOS> it may do very well for the others   replied mr bingley   but i am sure it will be too much for kitty <EOS> 94.17003582707456
<SOS> in the evening  soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library  she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on seeing it was extreme <EOS> 230.3523213132216
<SOS> have not you always hated him <EOS> 295.18303036194635
<SOS> how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable  her expressions more moderate <EOS> 463.4566914684351
<SOS> i know your disposition  lizzy <EOS> 269.34071324151347
<SOS> your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage <EOS> 524.9417978662254
<SOS> he heard her with astonishment <EOS> 256.1239265346103
<SOS> every thing was too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away  there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time <EOS> 280.0913826499705
<SOS> nor was it under many  many minutes  that she could comprehend what she heard  though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them <EOS> 185.41256287704257
<SOS> this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted  and elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself  soon went away <EOS> 350.2860969924497
<SOS> and a special licence <EOS> 318.17093796634924
<SOS> this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be  and elizabeth found  that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of her relations  consent  there was still something to be wished for <EOS> 188.7745447209218
<SOS> you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking  and thinking for  your  approbation alone <EOS> 284.5614139933898
<SOS> and so was i <EOS> 132.00004295475102
<SOS> i wonder when you  would  have spoken  if i had not asked you <EOS> 98.17734885975965
<SOS> too much   i am afraid  for what becomes of the moral  if our comfort springs from a breach of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the subject <EOS> 251.86570576742338
<SOS> lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us  were the means of removing all my doubts <EOS> 461.45288441564765
<SOS> my real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if i could  whether i might ever hope to make you love me <EOS> 176.03548626755156
<SOS> but it ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it shall be done directly <EOS> 128.75743854554526
