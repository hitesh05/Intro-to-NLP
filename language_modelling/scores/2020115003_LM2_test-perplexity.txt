<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr <EOS>	3.7374475045867377

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my <EOS>	6.920325440087856
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham.wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison.but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry.the necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurd.i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country.but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.i had often seen him in love before.at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their <EOS>	3.056481017812779
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be <EOS>	6.464084167267213
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard.but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult <EOS>	3.1257387845624933
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them.with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my <EOS>	3.895156601594993
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally <EOS>	5.991655910802866

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an <EOS>	2.763256247270559
