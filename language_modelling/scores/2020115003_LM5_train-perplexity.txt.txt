<SOS> <SOS> it is a truth universally acknowledged  that a single man in possession of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife <EOS> <EOS> 226.7179601710625

<SOS> <SOS> you  want to tell me  and i have no objection to hearing it <EOS> <EOS> 112.49194574236697

<SOS> <SOS> how can it affect them <EOS> <EOS> 312.2203018736119
<SOS> <SOS> my dear mr bennet   replied his wife   how can you be so tiresome <EOS> <EOS> 151.3670284435007
<SOS> <SOS> you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them <EOS> <EOS> 88.7486625579978

<SOS> <SOS> nonsense  how can you talk so <EOS> <EOS> 337.766093649848
<SOS> <SOS> you and the girls may go  or you may send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for as you are as handsome as any of them  mr bingley might like you the best of the party <EOS> <EOS> 195.5508649179977
<SOS> <SOS> when a woman has five grown up daughters  she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty <EOS> <EOS> 383.4548165628098
<SOS> <SOS> in such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of <EOS> <EOS> 207.93771302307547
<SOS> <SOS> but  my dear  you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood <EOS> <EOS> 177.98702860822019
<SOS> <SOS> it is more than i engage for  i assure you <EOS> <EOS> 141.64926587860168
<SOS> <SOS> only think what an establishment it would be for one of them <EOS> <EOS> 170.61001972649316
<SOS> <SOS> sir william and lady lucas are determined to go  merely on that account  for in general you know they visit no new comers <EOS> <EOS> 388.39362044257973
<SOS> <SOS> indeed you must go  for it will be impossible for  us  to visit him  if you do not <EOS> <EOS> 80.66393879973411
<SOS> <SOS> i desire you will do no such thing <EOS> <EOS> 155.71932249868144
<SOS> <SOS> but you are always giving  her  the preference <EOS> <EOS> 183.22559895682127
<SOS> <SOS> they have none of them much to recommend them   replied he   they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters <EOS> <EOS> 392.2379300986315
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way <EOS> <EOS> 156.52143290924303
<SOS> <SOS> you take delight in vexing me <EOS> <EOS> 203.88248882988535
<SOS> <SOS> you have no compassion on my poor nerves <EOS> <EOS> 199.810218766716
<SOS> <SOS> i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least <EOS> <EOS> 365.57779061402965
<SOS> <SOS> ah <EOS> <EOS> 279.94843002238997
<SOS> <SOS> you do not know what i suffer <EOS> <EOS> 93.92796339633144
<SOS> <SOS> but i hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood <EOS> <EOS> 276.7659674284215
<SOS> <SOS> it will be no use to us  if twenty such should come since you will not visit them <EOS> <EOS> 223.07088774615275
<SOS> <SOS> depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  i will visit them all <EOS> <EOS> 290.7502888382272
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour  reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character <EOS> <EOS> 291.3330682250739
<SOS> <SOS> her  mind was less difficult to develope <EOS> <EOS> 144.42794406219576
<SOS> <SOS> she was a woman of mean understanding  little information  and uncertain temper <EOS> <EOS> 308.7360723130879
<SOS> <SOS> when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous <EOS> <EOS> 269.5166517226587
<SOS> <SOS> chapter ii <EOS> <EOS> 343.8286020008905
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley <EOS> <EOS> 175.68741678442706
<SOS> <SOS> he had always intended to visit him  though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go  and till the evening after the visit was paid  she had no knowledge of it <EOS> <EOS> 148.5148716238542
<SOS> <SOS> observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat  he suddenly addressed her with   i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy <EOS> <EOS> 384.1372572033405
<SOS> <SOS> we are not in a way to know  what  mr bingley likes   said her mother resentfully   since we are not to visit <EOS> <EOS> 169.71660236418222
<SOS> <SOS> long will do any such thing <EOS> <EOS> 219.17916547156528
<SOS> <SOS> no more have i   said mr bennet   and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you <EOS> <EOS> 78.94662008908217
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet deigned not to make any reply  but unable to contain herself  began scolding one of her daughters <EOS> <EOS> 383.0499777604012
<SOS> <SOS> don t keep coughing so  kitty  for heaven s sake <EOS> <EOS> 543.1033631617128
<SOS> <SOS> you tear them to pieces <EOS> <EOS> 243.89724356494247
<SOS> <SOS> i do not cough for my own amusement   replied kitty fretfully <EOS> <EOS> 228.9921088680481
<SOS> <SOS> when is your next ball to be  lizzy <EOS> <EOS> 233.68540245237477
<SOS> <SOS> aye  so it is   cried her mother   and mr <EOS> <EOS> 206.29437321441904
<SOS> <SOS> long does not come back till the day before  so  it will be impossible for her to introduce him  for she will not know him herself <EOS> <EOS> 168.40236618569185
<SOS> <SOS> then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and introduce mr bingley to  her <EOS> <EOS> 83.74763915046434
<SOS> <SOS> impossible  mr bennet  impossible  when i am not acquainted with him myself  how can you be so teazing <EOS> <EOS> 178.94690949682894
<SOS> <SOS> i honour your circumspection <EOS> <EOS> 256.3008244319967
<SOS> <SOS> a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little <EOS> <EOS> 223.22069478497104
<SOS> <SOS> one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight <EOS> <EOS> 176.45152478375798
<SOS> <SOS> but if  we  do not venture  somebody else will  and after all  mr <EOS> <EOS> 393.49560607171355
<SOS> <SOS> long and her nieces must stand their chance  and therefore  as she will think it an act of kindness  if you decline the office  i will take it on myself <EOS> <EOS> 271.5607102732258
<SOS> <SOS> what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation <EOS> <EOS> 162.44733778223326
<SOS> <SOS> cried he <EOS> <EOS> 159.782309914869
<SOS> <SOS> do you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that is laid on them  as nonsense <EOS> <EOS> 184.05656616616835
<SOS> <SOS> mary wished to say something very sensible  but knew not how <EOS> <EOS> 525.4954486081931
<SOS> <SOS> while mary is adjusting her ideas   he continued   let us return to mr bingley <EOS> <EOS> 325.6031301757992
<SOS> <SOS> i am sick of mr bingley   cried his wife <EOS> <EOS> 118.88086492329855
<SOS> <SOS> if i had known as much this morning  i certainly would not have called on him <EOS> <EOS> 174.69038854426051
<SOS> <SOS> bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though when the first tumult of joy was over  she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while <EOS> <EOS> 187.83531438283924
<SOS> <SOS> how good it was in you  my dear mr bennet <EOS> <EOS> 104.71308311967391
<SOS> <SOS> but i knew i should persuade you at last <EOS> <EOS> 170.2784740477868
<SOS> <SOS> well  how pleased i am <EOS> <EOS> 175.2368922362269
<SOS> <SOS> what an excellent father you have  girls   said she  when the door was shut <EOS> <EOS> 231.82457872384953
<SOS> <SOS> i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness  or me either  for that matter <EOS> <EOS> 163.60540126769178
<SOS> <SOS> at our time of life  it is not so pleasant i can tell you  to be making new acquaintance every day  but for your sakes  we would do any thing <EOS> <EOS> 184.36499776886276
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> said lydia stoutly   i am not afraid  for though i  am  the youngest  i m the tallest <EOS> <EOS> 115.97272408338954
<SOS> <SOS> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet s visit  and determining when they should ask him to dinner <EOS> <EOS> 201.36105596492027
<SOS> <SOS> chapter iii <EOS> <EOS> 340.1736593035444
<SOS> <SOS> not all that mr <EOS> <EOS> 201.62789657890855
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  however  with the assistance of her five daughters  could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley <EOS> <EOS> 235.75697656333608
<SOS> <SOS> her report was highly favourable <EOS> <EOS> 256.6320967302115
<SOS> <SOS> nothing could be more delightful <EOS> <EOS> 181.23839665275258
<SOS> <SOS> to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love  and very lively hopes of mr bingley s heart were entertained <EOS> <EOS> 259.09345700305397
<SOS> <SOS> if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield   said mr <EOS> <EOS> 290.7126904952272
<SOS> <SOS> bennet to her husband   and all the others equally well married  i shall have nothing to wish for <EOS> <EOS> 191.38954981112994
<SOS> <SOS> in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet s visit  and sat about ten minutes with him in his library <EOS> <EOS> 200.94372481365713
<SOS> <SOS> he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose beauty he had heard much  but he saw only the father <EOS> <EOS> 179.66352710854994
<SOS> <SOS> the ladies were somewhat more fortunate  for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window  that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse <EOS> <EOS> 234.9792502327036
<SOS> <SOS> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and already had mr <EOS> <EOS> 522.963987050971
<SOS> <SOS> bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred it all <EOS> <EOS> 453.2425630457589
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day  and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation   c <EOS> <EOS> 167.94033469440745
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet was quite disconcerted <EOS> <EOS> 318.13808056542155
<SOS> <SOS> lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly <EOS> <EOS> 245.0339403943348
<SOS> <SOS> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies  but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing  that instead of twelve  he had brought only six with him from london  his five sisters and a cousin <EOS> <EOS> 279.84211604285497
<SOS> <SOS> and when the party entered the assembly room  it consisted of only five altogether  mr bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and another young man <EOS> <EOS> 338.60975761353126
<SOS> <SOS> his sisters were fine women  with an air of decided fashion <EOS> <EOS> 327.2561637891033
<SOS> <SOS> his brother in law  mr hurst  merely looked the gentleman  but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome features  noble mien  and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance  of his having ten thousand a year <EOS> <EOS> 347.18561134598275
<SOS> <SOS> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man  the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley  and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be proud  to be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be compared with his friend <EOS> <EOS> 224.97721421732516
<SOS> <SOS> such amiable qualities must speak for themselves <EOS> <EOS> 647.5409175090955
<SOS> <SOS> what a contrast between him and his friend <EOS> <EOS> 181.88096080750464
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy danced only once with mr <EOS> <EOS> 247.7082648283698
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and once with missingley  declined being introduced to any other lady  and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party <EOS> <EOS> 267.193168517266
<SOS> <SOS> his character was decided <EOS> <EOS> 172.88847274709207
<SOS> <SOS> amongst the most violent against him was mr <EOS> <EOS> 446.2225681059229
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  whose dislike of his general behaviour  was sharpened into particular resentment  by his having slighted one of her daughters <EOS> <EOS> 391.27575813081734
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen  to sit down for two dances  and during part of that time  mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley  who came from the dance for a few minutes  to press his friend to join it <EOS> <EOS> 183.5152111821178
<SOS> <SOS> you had much better dance <EOS> <EOS> 195.5079757163431
<SOS> <SOS> i certainly shall not <EOS> <EOS> 154.09052999125396
<SOS> <SOS> at such an assembly as this  it would be insupportable <EOS> <EOS> 167.0685809828675
<SOS> <SOS> your sisters are engaged  and there is not another woman in the room  whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with <EOS> <EOS> 126.33582916974036
<SOS> <SOS> i would not be so fastidious as you are   cried bingley   for a kingdom <EOS> <EOS> 118.42775102594578
<SOS> <SOS> which do you mean <EOS> <EOS> 185.09770420064686
<SOS> <SOS> and turning round  he looked for a moment at elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly said   she is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt  me   and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men <EOS> <EOS> 281.1123273680958
<SOS> <SOS> you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles  for you are wasting your time with me <EOS> <EOS> 137.46050943496684
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley followed his advice <EOS> <EOS> 194.80386136801414
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy walked off  and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him <EOS> <EOS> 237.42265739293921
<SOS> <SOS> she told the story however with great spirit among her friends  for she had a lively  playful disposition  which delighted in any thing ridiculous <EOS> <EOS> 353.7805625968426
<SOS> <SOS> the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family <EOS> <EOS> 312.62757971563815
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party <EOS> <EOS> 323.1377169966886
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley had danced with her twice  and she had been distinguished by his sisters <EOS> <EOS> 95.82496918882305
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth felt jane s pleasure <EOS> <EOS> 192.33068901453782
<SOS> <SOS> mary had heard herself mentioned to missingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood  and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners  which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball <EOS> <EOS> 207.21638037296643
<SOS> <SOS> they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which they were the principal inhabitants <EOS> <EOS> 280.6739244827691
<SOS> <SOS> they found mr bennet still up <EOS> <EOS> 235.9733650803689
<SOS> <SOS> with a book he was regardless of time  and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations <EOS> <EOS> 165.62555287876748
<SOS> <SOS> he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed  but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear <EOS> <EOS> 153.62047887320148
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> my dear mr bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a most delightful evening  a most excellent ball <EOS> <EOS> 180.65822986978924
<SOS> <SOS> i wish you had been there <EOS> <EOS> 112.12798548103659
<SOS> <SOS> jane was so admired  nothing could be like it <EOS> <EOS> 182.73603273789277
<SOS> <SOS> every body said how well she looked  and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful  and danced with her twice <EOS> <EOS> 250.99208423666153
<SOS> <SOS> only think of  that  my dear  he actually danced with her twice  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time <EOS> <EOS> 146.1896223551423
<SOS> <SOS> i was so vexed to see him stand up with her  but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody can  you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance <EOS> <EOS> 196.17444215738777
<SOS> <SOS> so  he enquired who she was  and got introduced  and asked her for the two next <EOS> <EOS> 244.58039291051136
<SOS> <SOS> for god s sake  say no more of his partners <EOS> <EOS> 284.6667789121609
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance <EOS> <EOS> 57.361990336667226
<SOS> <SOS> my dear   continued mr <EOS> <EOS> 176.70976328111007
<SOS> <SOS> bennet   i am quite delighted with him <EOS> <EOS> 174.6003077703962
<SOS> <SOS> he is so excessively handsome <EOS> <EOS> 179.67947338256874
<SOS> <SOS> and his sisters are charming women <EOS> <EOS> 296.0043246275365
<SOS> <SOS> i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses <EOS> <EOS> 199.99075993876534
<SOS> <SOS> i dare say the lace upon mr <EOS> <EOS> 186.51557693268816
<SOS> <SOS> hurst s gown      here she was interrupted again <EOS> <EOS> 381.76140799506214
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet protested against any description of finery <EOS> <EOS> 342.3952945474827
<SOS> <SOS> she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 204.82167306358346
<SOS> <SOS> so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him <EOS> <EOS> 136.0619812501933
<SOS> <SOS> he walked here  and he walked there  fancying himself so very great <EOS> <EOS> 247.29650700150347
<SOS> <SOS> i quite detest the man <EOS> <EOS> 246.71817337787172
<SOS> <SOS> chapter iv <EOS> <EOS> 353.4150122370763
<SOS> <SOS> when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before  expressed to her sister how very much she admired him <EOS> <EOS> 158.2708876339896
<SOS> <SOS> he is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible  good humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners <EOS> <EOS> 325.194430043412
<SOS> <SOS> so much ease  with such perfect good breeding <EOS> <EOS> 394.2931977774294

<SOS> <SOS> i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time <EOS> <EOS> 169.97820081611493
<SOS> <SOS> i did not expect such a compliment <EOS> <EOS> 139.43074634091874
<SOS> <SOS> i  did for you <EOS> <EOS> 96.7342138969384
<SOS> <SOS> but that is one great difference between us <EOS> <EOS> 304.47007163030446
<SOS> <SOS> he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room <EOS> <EOS> 175.66158956067068
<SOS> <SOS> no thanks to his gallantry for that <EOS> <EOS> 178.0195297546311

<SOS> <SOS> you are a great deal too apt you know  to like people in general <EOS> <EOS> 164.2874201027952
<SOS> <SOS> you never see a fault in any body <EOS> <EOS> 144.7108515597069
<SOS> <SOS> i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one  but i always speak what i think <EOS> <EOS> 126.34847082110765
<SOS> <SOS> with  your  good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others <EOS> <EOS> 187.8791936924673
<SOS> <SOS> affectation of candour is common enough   one meets it every where <EOS> <EOS> 806.7552414345648
<SOS> <SOS> but to be candid without ostentation or design  to take the good of every body s character and make it still better  and say nothing of the bad  belongs to you alone <EOS> <EOS> 209.8218017052763
<SOS> <SOS> their manners are not equal to his <EOS> <EOS> 141.27300055241597
<SOS> <SOS> certainly not  at first <EOS> <EOS> 218.4516029443319
<SOS> <SOS> but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them <EOS> <EOS> 210.77405234171314
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister  and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself  she was very little disposed to approve them <EOS> <EOS> 165.14357578565773
<SOS> <SOS> they were in fact very fine ladies  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased  nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it  but proud and conceited <EOS> <EOS> 333.60102342998823
<SOS> <SOS> they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and of associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of others <EOS> <EOS> 250.87085962219015
<SOS> <SOS> they were of a respectable family in the north of england  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade <EOS> <EOS> 233.0732630711249
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an estate  but did not live to do it <EOS> <EOS> 229.1640100083837
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley intended it likewise  and sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor  it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield  and leave the next generation to purchase <EOS> <EOS> 176.36584050603426
<SOS> <SOS> hurst  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune  less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her <EOS> <EOS> 296.0059878849531
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley had not been of age two years  when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house <EOS> <EOS> 210.74031541817172
<SOS> <SOS> he did look at it and into it for half an hour  was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms  satisfied with what the owner said in its praise  and took it immediately <EOS> <EOS> 261.18123885034584
<SOS> <SOS> bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness  openness  ductility of his temper  though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own  and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied <EOS> <EOS> 248.70422253311668
<SOS> <SOS> on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance  and of his judgment the highest opinion <EOS> <EOS> 188.80711965019688
<SOS> <SOS> he was at the same time haughty  reserved  and fastidious  and his manners  though well bred  were not inviting <EOS> <EOS> 313.1794252251865
<SOS> <SOS> in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage <EOS> <EOS> 230.5634552889124
<SOS> <SOS> bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually giving offence <EOS> <EOS> 601.3700165928441
<SOS> <SOS> the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic <EOS> <EOS> 288.4176719959606
<SOS> <SOS> darcy  on the contrary  had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion  for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest  and from none received either attention or pleasure <EOS> <EOS> 308.8036828173216
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and her sister allowed it to be so  but still they admired her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl  and one whom they should not object to know more of <EOS> <EOS> 188.3996708046842
<SOS> <SOS> missennet was therefore established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose <EOS> <EOS> 307.33579872912367
<SOS> <SOS> within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate <EOS> <EOS> 365.0097471410981

<SOS> <SOS> the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly <EOS> <EOS> 400.0456550781112
<SOS> <SOS> it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town  and quitting them both  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge  where he could think with pleasure of his own importance  and unshackled by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world <EOS> <EOS> 228.12548816006782

<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice <EOS> <EOS> 286.8211057846134
<SOS> <SOS> to be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her  indeed i rather believe he  did   i heard something about it  but i hardly know what  something about mr robinson <EOS> <EOS> 326.2423811783008
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson  did not i mention it to you <EOS> <EOS> 219.6459522016879
<SOS> <SOS> well  that was very decided indeed  that does seem as if    but however  it may all come to nothing you know <EOS> <EOS> 253.6358633583693
<SOS> <SOS> my  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   eliza   said charlotte <EOS> <EOS> 280.2948416617803
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend  is he <EOS> <EOS> 126.06813436973914

<SOS> <SOS> i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him <EOS> <EOS> 147.1724327316702
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips <EOS> <EOS> 412.74192517963627
<SOS> <SOS> are you quite sure  ma am <EOS> <EOS> 378.1062271837082
<SOS> <SOS> is not there a little mistake <EOS> <EOS> 217.86099599664385
<SOS> <SOS> said jane <EOS> <EOS> 126.48657930941663
<SOS> <SOS> i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her <EOS> <EOS> 115.92822295222352
<SOS> <SOS> aye  because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and he could not help answering her   but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to <EOS> <EOS> 258.74455514149247
<SOS> <SOS> missingley told me   said jane   that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance <EOS> <EOS> 366.1500400252967
<SOS> <SOS> if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mr <EOS> <EOS> 116.10779267075968
<SOS> <SOS> long <EOS> <EOS> 191.53190079049105
<SOS> <SOS> but i can guess how it was  every body says that he is ate up with pride  and i dare say he had heard somehow that mr <EOS> <EOS> 232.9836288438028
<SOS> <SOS> long does not keep a carriage  and had come to the ball in a hack chaise <EOS> <EOS> 162.9375839709382
<SOS> <SOS> long   said missucas   but i wish he had danced with eliza <EOS> <EOS> 330.6098738216868
<SOS> <SOS> i believe  ma am  i may safely promise you  never  to dance with him <EOS> <EOS> 360.95636669651304
<SOS> <SOS> one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune  every thing in his favour  should think highly of himself <EOS> <EOS> 328.94532444324255
<SOS> <SOS> if i may so express it  he has a  right  to be proud <EOS> <EOS> 153.13983222115127
<SOS> <SOS> that is very true   replied elizabeth   and i could easily forgive  his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine <EOS> <EOS> 244.17208650363668
<SOS> <SOS> pride   observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections   is a very common failing i believe <EOS> <EOS> 331.670176769521
<SOS> <SOS> vanity and pride are different things  though the words are often used synonimously <EOS> <EOS> 492.2445575676115
<SOS> <SOS> if i were as rich as mr darcy   cried a young lucas who came with his sisters   i should not care how proud i was <EOS> <EOS> 184.02497363638278
<SOS> <SOS> i would keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine every day <EOS> <EOS> 215.55534991851857
<SOS> <SOS> then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said mr <EOS> <EOS> 283.64584962862136
<SOS> <SOS> bennet   and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly <EOS> <EOS> 187.22011734803442
<SOS> <SOS> the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare that she would  and the argument ended only with the visit <EOS> <EOS> 182.5588527517994
<SOS> <SOS> chapter vi <EOS> <EOS> 344.3794511148922
<SOS> <SOS> the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 218.94123738339133
<SOS> <SOS> the visit was returned in due form <EOS> <EOS> 272.0485572503506
<SOS> <SOS> missennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mr <EOS> <EOS> 604.1660499119049
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and missingley  and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to  a wish of being better acquainted with  them   was expressed towards the two eldest <EOS> <EOS> 217.9750446451991
<SOS> <SOS> it was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire her  and to  her  it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first  and was in a way to be very much in love  but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general  since jane united with great strength of feeling  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner  which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent <EOS> <EOS> 147.83268459501622
<SOS> <SOS> she mentioned this to her friend missucas <EOS> <EOS> 201.02825042779745
<SOS> <SOS> it may perhaps be pleasant   replied charlotte   to be able to impose on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded <EOS> <EOS> 176.0582297456155
<SOS> <SOS> if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose the opportunity of fixing him  and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark <EOS> <EOS> 203.5842446692959
<SOS> <SOS> there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it is not safe to leave any to itself <EOS> <EOS> 181.39800227452812
<SOS> <SOS> in nine cases out of ten  a woman had better shew  more  affection than she feels <EOS> <EOS> 509.2449661012434
<SOS> <SOS> bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he may never do more than like her  if she does not help him on <EOS> <EOS> 238.41142326376402
<SOS> <SOS> but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow <EOS> <EOS> 201.19370486093888
<SOS> <SOS> if  i  can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too <EOS> <EOS> 174.83756735726104
<SOS> <SOS> remember  eliza  that he does not know jane s disposition as you do <EOS> <EOS> 168.43235877269814
<SOS> <SOS> but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to conceal it  he must find it out <EOS> <EOS> 188.9686557357053
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her <EOS> <EOS> 221.97898985830793
<SOS> <SOS> but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours together  and as they always see each other in large mixed parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together <EOS> <EOS> 382.9513482466495
<SOS> <SOS> jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention <EOS> <EOS> 322.4539598634158
<SOS> <SOS> your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married  and if i were determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i should adopt it <EOS> <EOS> 266.87176408519326
<SOS> <SOS> but these are not jane s feelings  she is not acting by design <EOS> <EOS> 210.17388833806476
<SOS> <SOS> as yet  she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard  nor of its reasonableness <EOS> <EOS> 133.0982317151731

<SOS> <SOS> happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance <EOS> <EOS> 316.68187058011966
<SOS> <SOS> if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other  or ever so similar before hand  it does not advance their felicity in the least <EOS> <EOS> 272.55536655043403
<SOS> <SOS> they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation  and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life <EOS> <EOS> 225.99333476604514
<SOS> <SOS> you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound <EOS> <EOS> 191.22295281166595
<SOS> <SOS> you know it is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself <EOS> <EOS> 106.34805207581861
<SOS> <SOS> occupied in observing mr bingley s attentions to her sister  elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend <EOS> <EOS> 146.60306621100517
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at her without admiration at the ball  and when they next met  he looked at her only to criticise <EOS> <EOS> 177.8016171680651
<SOS> <SOS> though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world  he was caught by their easy playfulness <EOS> <EOS> 144.60392036045718
<SOS> <SOS> of this she was perfectly unaware   to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with <EOS> <EOS> 174.16788227604653
<SOS> <SOS> he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards conversing with her himself  attended to her conversation with others <EOS> <EOS> 177.96656202271274
<SOS> <SOS> it was at sir william lucas s  where a large party were assembled <EOS> <EOS> 357.54789043097054
<SOS> <SOS> what does mr darcy mean   said she to charlotte   by listening to my conversation with colonel forster <EOS> <EOS> 235.02409458871693
<SOS> <SOS> that is a question which mr darcy only can answer <EOS> <EOS> 124.99111825978848
<SOS> <SOS> but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about <EOS> <EOS> 144.35751484703746
<SOS> <SOS> on his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming to have any intention of speaking  missucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it  she turned to him and said   did not you think  mr darcy  that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now  when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton <EOS> <EOS> 278.7543566039699

<SOS> <SOS> after a song or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary  who having  in consequence of being the only plain one in the family  worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments  was always impatient for display <EOS> <EOS> 315.24067071119595
<SOS> <SOS> mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given her application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner  which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached <EOS> <EOS> 389.4701857631059
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  easy and unaffected  had been listened to with much more pleasure  though not playing half so well  and mary  at the end of a long concerto  was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs  at the request of her younger sisters  who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room <EOS> <EOS> 268.59635851257184
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour  till sir william thus began <EOS> <EOS> 273.41690894792197
<SOS> <SOS> what a charming amusement for young people this is  mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 330.491266993486
<SOS> <SOS> i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies <EOS> <EOS> 131.6989629595465

<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy bowed <EOS> <EOS> 113.22942043009667

<SOS> <SOS> he paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not disposed to make any  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them  he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing  and called out to her   my dear missliza  why are not you dancing <EOS> <EOS> 238.89436248922718
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy  you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner <EOS> <EOS> 171.21989210266915
<SOS> <SOS> you cannot refuse to dance  i am sure  when so much beauty is before you <EOS> <EOS> 173.9237582481047
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was determined  nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion <EOS> <EOS> 403.1874873425943
<SOS> <SOS> you excel so much in the dance  missliza  that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general  he can have no objection  i am sure  to oblige us for one half hour <EOS> <EOS> 240.176292501681
<SOS> <SOS> he is indeed  but considering the inducement  my dear missliza  we cannot wonder at his complaisance  for who would object to such a partner <EOS> <EOS> 321.0822733257602
<SOS> <SOS> her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with some complacency  when thus accosted by missingley   i can guess the subject of your reverie <EOS> <EOS> 190.33183749395567
<SOS> <SOS> i should imagine not <EOS> <EOS> 160.5087690691678
<SOS> <SOS> i was never more annoyed <EOS> <EOS> 112.52738778062994
<SOS> <SOS> what would i give to hear your strictures on them <EOS> <EOS> 133.258565380501
<SOS> <SOS> my mind was more agreeably engaged <EOS> <EOS> 264.3793922323051
<SOS> <SOS> i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow <EOS> <EOS> 199.2989415351747
<SOS> <SOS> missingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections <EOS> <EOS> 244.51704878431931
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy replied with great intrepidity   misslizabeth bennet <EOS> <EOS> 174.21121906066088
<SOS> <SOS> misslizabeth bennet <EOS> <EOS> 347.2664426538392
<SOS> <SOS> how long has she been such a favourite <EOS> <EOS> 247.39363332456531
<SOS> <SOS> that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask <EOS> <EOS> 204.97054397215842
<SOS> <SOS> a lady s imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to love  from love to matrimony in a moment <EOS> <EOS> 245.66525032887353
<SOS> <SOS> you will have a charming mother in law  indeed  and of course she will be always at pemberley with you <EOS> <EOS> 138.97817940671453
<SOS> <SOS> he listened to her with perfect indifference  while she chose to entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced her that all was safe  her wit flowed long <EOS> <EOS> 291.4724615407323
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was entailed in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and their mother s fortune  though ample for her situation in life  could but ill supply the deficiency of his <EOS> <EOS> 265.544219802772
<SOS> <SOS> she had a sister married to a mr philips  who had been a clerk to their father  and succeeded him in the business  and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade <EOS> <EOS> 138.6321036049625
<SOS> <SOS> the two youngest of the family  catherine and lydia  were particularly frequent in these attentions  their minds were more vacant than their sisters   and when nothing better offered  a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening  and however bare of news the country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some from their aunt <EOS> <EOS> 412.2858664010692
<SOS> <SOS> at present  indeed  they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter  and meryton was the head quarters <EOS> <EOS> 270.7431868701872
<SOS> <SOS> their visits to mr <EOS> <EOS> 361.3821659835452
<SOS> <SOS> every day added something to their knowledge of the officers  names and connections <EOS> <EOS> 281.9874642171849
<SOS> <SOS> they could talk of nothing but officers  and mr bingley s large fortune  the mention of which gave animation to their mother  was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign <EOS> <EOS> 186.21459317672213
<SOS> <SOS> after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject  mr bennet coolly observed   from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must be two of the silliest girls in the country <EOS> <EOS> 199.89387354485754
<SOS> <SOS> i have suspected it some time  but i am now convinced <EOS> <EOS> 143.78050606513975
<SOS> <SOS> catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but lydia  with perfect indifference  continued to express her admiration of captain carter  and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day  as he was going the next morning to london <EOS> <EOS> 201.6691792894871
<SOS> <SOS> bennet   that you should be so ready to think your own children silly <EOS> <EOS> 144.87793220873698
<SOS> <SOS> if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children  it should not be of my own however <EOS> <EOS> 114.50182112018067
<SOS> <SOS> yes  but as it happens  they are all of them very clever <EOS> <EOS> 220.58208707363076
<SOS> <SOS> this is the only point  i flatter myself  on which we do not agree <EOS> <EOS> 244.85109580719813
<SOS> <SOS> i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular  but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish <EOS> <EOS> 307.03285459625454
<SOS> <SOS> my dear mr bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother <EOS> <EOS> 91.88500390920525
<SOS> <SOS> when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do <EOS> <EOS> 274.886329314427
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for missennet  it came from netherfield  and the servant waited for an answer <EOS> <EOS> 213.38566801514267

<SOS> <SOS> it is from missingley   said jane  and then read it aloud <EOS> <EOS> 201.3812211483492
<SOS> <SOS> my dear friend        if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and      me  we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives  for a whole day s t te   t te between two women can never      end without a quarrel <EOS> <EOS> 275.86401307640807

<SOS> <SOS> no  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems likely to rain  and then you must stay all night <EOS> <EOS> 396.9203042294063
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> i had much rather go in the coach <EOS> <EOS> 144.2172592383387
<SOS> <SOS> but  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  i am sure <EOS> <EOS> 185.2967138314139
<SOS> <SOS> they are wanted in the farm  mr bennet  are not they <EOS> <EOS> 172.0609319646029
<SOS> <SOS> they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them <EOS> <EOS> 317.86212405959145
<SOS> <SOS> she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged <EOS> <EOS> 176.9393954350809
<SOS> <SOS> jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback  and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day <EOS> <EOS> 198.47569311434745
<SOS> <SOS> her hopes were answered  jane had not been gone long before it rained hard <EOS> <EOS> 255.7717020308819
<SOS> <SOS> the rain continued the whole evening without intermission  jane certainly could not come back <EOS> <EOS> 458.11598856383614
<SOS> <SOS> this was a lucky idea of mine  indeed <EOS> <EOS> 292.73942644891144
<SOS> <SOS> said mr <EOS> <EOS> 213.24982131861415
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  more than once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own <EOS> <EOS> 229.67332999965396
<SOS> <SOS> till the next morning  however  she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance <EOS> <EOS> 120.46659372155814
<SOS> <SOS> breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth        my dearest lizzy        i find myself very unwell this morning  which  i suppose  is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday <EOS> <EOS> 519.552014169919
<SOS> <SOS> they insist also on      my seeing mr jones  therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me  and excepting a sore throat and head ache      there is not much the matter with me <EOS> <EOS> 180.57752936471806
<SOS> <SOS> well  my dear   said mr bennet  when elizabeth had read the note aloud   if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness  if she should die  it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley  and under your orders <EOS> <EOS> 131.14354213194468
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583

<SOS> <SOS> as long as she stays there  it is all very well <EOS> <EOS> 101.20542609909783
<SOS> <SOS> i would go and see her  if i could have the carriage <EOS> <EOS> 105.8497944645574
<SOS> <SOS> how can you be so silly   cried her mother   as to think of such a thing  in all this dirt <EOS> <EOS> 131.7581498828332
<SOS> <SOS> you will not be fit to be seen when you get there <EOS> <EOS> 109.25321008432395
<SOS> <SOS> is this a hint to me  lizzy   said her father   to send for the horses <EOS> <EOS> 157.50291060154274
<SOS> <SOS> the distance is nothing  when one has a motive  only three miles <EOS> <EOS> 368.40583986598654
<SOS> <SOS> i admire the activity of your benevolence   observed mary   but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my opinion  exertion should always be in proportion to what is required <EOS> <EOS> 346.96569694324097
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young ladies set off together <EOS> <EOS> 476.5813719631532
<SOS> <SOS> in meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers  wives  and elizabeth continued her walk alone  crossing field after field at a quick pace  jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity  and finding herself at last within view of the house  with weary ancles  dirty stockings  and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise <EOS> <EOS> 305.2863679032564
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and missingley  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it <EOS> <EOS> 174.16209932835727
<SOS> <SOS> she was received  however  very politely by them  and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness  there was good humour and kindness <EOS> <EOS> 241.32068235650698
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy said very little  and mr hurst nothing at all <EOS> <EOS> 117.5880245243265
<SOS> <SOS> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone <EOS> <EOS> 251.6951330308503
<SOS> <SOS> the latter was thinking only of his breakfast <EOS> <EOS> 186.87913932766267
<SOS> <SOS> her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered <EOS> <EOS> 200.22594353155182
<SOS> <SOS> missennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room <EOS> <EOS> 225.77195086065154
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately  and jane  who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience  from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit  was delighted at her entrance <EOS> <EOS> 191.25276350550502
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth silently attended her <EOS> <EOS> 233.5864783032787
<SOS> <SOS> when breakfast was over  they were joined by the sisters  and elizabeth began to like them herself  when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane <EOS> <EOS> 241.6189531787779
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were the other ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere <EOS> <EOS> 280.35962378757165
<SOS> <SOS> when the clock struck three  elizabeth felt that she must go  and very unwillingly said so <EOS> <EOS> 270.77447212802383
<SOS> <SOS> missingley offered her the carriage  and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it  when jane testified such concern in parting with her  that missingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present <EOS> <EOS> 224.04388185886864

<SOS> <SOS> jane was by no means better <EOS> <EOS> 153.24122243844297
<SOS> <SOS> the sisters  on hearing this  repeated three or four times how much they were grieved  how shocking it was to have a bad cold  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves  and then thought no more of the matter  and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them  restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike <EOS> <EOS> 430.9758049881437
<SOS> <SOS> their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency <EOS> <EOS> 180.65629521697377
<SOS> <SOS> when dinner was over  she returned directly to jane  and missingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room <EOS> <EOS> 176.16708209963178
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822

<SOS> <SOS> very nonsensical to come at all <EOS> <EOS> 188.83761672878288
<SOS> <SOS> why must  she  be scampering about the country  because her sister had a cold <EOS> <EOS> 170.18195904459682
<SOS> <SOS> her hair so untidy  so blowsy <EOS> <EOS> 128.50554454576456
<SOS> <SOS> your picture may be very exact  louisa   said bingley   but this was all lost upon me <EOS> <EOS> 315.1274394956469
<SOS> <SOS> i thought misslizabeth bennet looked remarkably well  when she came into the room this morning <EOS> <EOS> 452.94835843300336
<SOS> <SOS> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice <EOS> <EOS> 709.3001166362762
<SOS> <SOS> certainly not <EOS> <EOS> 187.45688637244726
<SOS> <SOS> to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever it is  above her ancles in dirt  and alone  quite alone <EOS> <EOS> 588.2303759304364
<SOS> <SOS> it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing   said bingley <EOS> <EOS> 165.84106058833783
<SOS> <SOS> i am afraid  mr darcy   observed missingley  in a half whisper   that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes <EOS> <EOS> 306.8642760081841
<SOS> <SOS> a short pause followed this speech  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 476.5915865634078
<SOS> <SOS> hurst began again <EOS> <EOS> 350.98682941693664
<SOS> <SOS> but with such a father and mother  and such low connections  i am afraid there is no chance of it <EOS> <EOS> 127.459932188256
<SOS> <SOS> yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside <EOS> <EOS> 908.741302824115
<SOS> <SOS> that is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed heartily <EOS> <EOS> 344.39649136367177
<SOS> <SOS> but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world   replied darcy <EOS> <EOS> 305.6107450485309
<SOS> <SOS> to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations <EOS> <EOS> 305.6694698253891
<SOS> <SOS> with a renewal of tenderness  however  they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour  and sat with her till summoned to coffee <EOS> <EOS> 286.4884259961457
<SOS> <SOS> on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo  and was immediately invited to join them  but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse  said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book <EOS> <EOS> 281.86971068736364
<SOS> <SOS> do you prefer reading to cards <EOS> <EOS> 480.4695000867656

<SOS> <SOS> missliza bennet   said missingley   despises cards <EOS> <EOS> 504.6025768739607
<SOS> <SOS> i deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried elizabeth   i am  not  a great reader  and i have pleasure in many things <EOS> <EOS> 320.88544330624904
<SOS> <SOS> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure   said bingley   and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well <EOS> <EOS> 127.72877142663359
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying <EOS> <EOS> 222.73000780129445

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room <EOS> <EOS> 198.88268710508794

<SOS> <SOS> your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said darcy   has too much truth <EOS> <EOS> 397.03576014575685

<SOS> <SOS> then   observed elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman <EOS> <EOS> 251.5319144979807

<SOS> <SOS> all this she must possess   added darcy   and to all this she must yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading <EOS> <EOS> 329.02808399151587
<SOS> <SOS> i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished women <EOS> <EOS> 421.76793475649555
<SOS> <SOS> are you so severe upon your own sex  as to doubt the possibility of all this <EOS> <EOS> 185.41030864612617
<SOS> <SOS> i  never saw such a woman <EOS> <EOS> 132.2876853834134
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and missingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description  when mr hurst called them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward <EOS> <EOS> 436.58247743313893
<SOS> <SOS> as all conversation was thereby at an end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the room <EOS> <EOS> 283.67589747074317
<SOS> <SOS> undoubtedly   replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly addressed   there is meanness in  all  the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation <EOS> <EOS> 264.5613807842523
<SOS> <SOS> whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable <EOS> <EOS> 320.86255314158166
<SOS> <SOS> missingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject <EOS> <EOS> 241.50607004627653
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse  and that she could not leave her <EOS> <EOS> 81.2953262956038
<SOS> <SOS> bingley urged mr jones s being sent for immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians <EOS> <EOS> 323.80876137451025
<SOS> <SOS> this  she would not hear of  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal  and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning  if missennet were not decidedly better <EOS> <EOS> 160.25901262291495
<SOS> <SOS> bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters declared that they were miserable <EOS> <EOS> 334.8677014440335
<SOS> <SOS> they solaced their wretchedness  however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister <EOS> <EOS> 314.49854721783163
<SOS> <SOS> chapter ix <EOS> <EOS> 369.3769069029226
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters <EOS> <EOS> 168.99538703854233
<SOS> <SOS> in spite of this amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her own judgment of her situation <EOS> <EOS> 236.3076059619858
<SOS> <SOS> the note was immediately dispatched  and its contents as quickly complied with <EOS> <EOS> 381.173294603749
<SOS> <SOS> bennet would have been very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 263.34043833334573
<SOS> <SOS> she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home  neither did the apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all advisable <EOS> <EOS> 332.8457775397167
<SOS> <SOS> bingley met them with hopes that mr <EOS> <EOS> 366.5478101002901
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had not found missennet worse than she expected <EOS> <EOS> 404.7351122152267

<SOS> <SOS> you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope  though you have but a short lease <EOS> <EOS> 104.14182518929964
<SOS> <SOS> whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in five minutes <EOS> <EOS> 260.2133751996013
<SOS> <SOS> at present  however  i consider myself as quite fixed here <EOS> <EOS> 486.99597346789795
<SOS> <SOS> that is exactly what i should have supposed of you   said elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 115.89009888435251

<SOS> <SOS> i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful <EOS> <EOS> 247.03143845956163
<SOS> <SOS> that is as it happens <EOS> <EOS> 132.03031828406571

<SOS> <SOS> i did not know before   continued bingley immediately   that you were a studier of character <EOS> <EOS> 121.08374485467365
<SOS> <SOS> it must be an amusing study <EOS> <EOS> 179.50327670251409
<SOS> <SOS> the country   said darcy   can in general supply but few subjects for such a study <EOS> <EOS> 313.0027709136625
<SOS> <SOS> but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new to be observed in them for ever <EOS> <EOS> 210.22403422710084
<SOS> <SOS> yes  indeed   cried mr <EOS> <EOS> 494.83047470025167
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood <EOS> <EOS> 345.84902652706126
<SOS> <SOS> i assure you there is quite as much of  that  going on in the country as in town <EOS> <EOS> 148.7867624524081
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822

<SOS> <SOS> the country is a vast deal pleasanter  is not it  mr bingley <EOS> <EOS> 279.51312063964195
<SOS> <SOS> when i am in the country   he replied   i never wish to leave it  and when i am in town it is pretty much the same <EOS> <EOS> 94.26854295003689
<SOS> <SOS> they have each their advantages  and i can be equally happy in either <EOS> <EOS> 235.1504443361002
<SOS> <SOS> aye  that is because you have the right disposition <EOS> <EOS> 234.2689406108536
<SOS> <SOS> but that gentleman   looking at darcy   seemed to think the country was nothing at all <EOS> <EOS> 252.40017785201266
<SOS> <SOS> indeed  mama  you are mistaken   said elizabeth  blushing for her mother <EOS> <EOS> 198.04729939223492
<SOS> <SOS> you quite mistook mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 86.11560253124067
<SOS> <SOS> he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town  which you must acknowledge to be true <EOS> <EOS> 143.97405342678329
<SOS> <SOS> certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood  i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger <EOS> <EOS> 291.28150776796144
<SOS> <SOS> i know we dine with four and twenty families <EOS> <EOS> 442.7779153552624
<SOS> <SOS> nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance <EOS> <EOS> 208.54989679474755
<SOS> <SOS> his sister was less delicate  and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile <EOS> <EOS> 186.2541163683602
<SOS> <SOS> what an agreeable man sir william is  mr bingley  is not he <EOS> <EOS> 257.6939957400944
<SOS> <SOS> so much the man of fashion <EOS> <EOS> 152.42241094736443
<SOS> <SOS> he has always something to say to every body <EOS> <EOS> 131.60926407241124
<SOS> <SOS> that  is my idea of good breeding  and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths  quite mistake the matter <EOS> <EOS> 528.3659695809125

<SOS> <SOS> she seems a very pleasant young woman   said bingley <EOS> <EOS> 253.23703519800313
<SOS> <SOS> dear  yes   but you must own she is very plain <EOS> <EOS> 264.0923807798722
<SOS> <SOS> i do not like to boast of my own child  but to be sure  jane  one does not often see any body better looking <EOS> <EOS> 171.2248570845469

<SOS> <SOS> i do not trust my own partiality <EOS> <EOS> 130.16080154452152
<SOS> <SOS> when she was only fifteen  there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town  so much in love with her  that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away <EOS> <EOS> 180.36744670790912
<SOS> <SOS> but however he did not <EOS> <EOS> 82.40648988307645
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps he thought her too young <EOS> <EOS> 162.45076099541697
<SOS> <SOS> however  he wrote some verses on her  and very pretty they were <EOS> <EOS> 164.13291166186136
<SOS> <SOS> and so ended his affection   said elizabeth impatiently <EOS> <EOS> 293.9178820812547
<SOS> <SOS> there has been many a one  i fancy  overcome in the same way <EOS> <EOS> 210.4601338410777
<SOS> <SOS> i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love <EOS> <EOS> 338.56025436985493
<SOS> <SOS> of a fine  stout  healthy love it may <EOS> <EOS> 162.33059647859224
<SOS> <SOS> but if it be only a slight  thin sort of inclination  i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away <EOS> <EOS> 257.6938243650616
<SOS> <SOS> darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again <EOS> <EOS> 385.43481940591295
<SOS> <SOS> she longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say  and after a short silence mr <EOS> <EOS> 195.70850473213153
<SOS> <SOS> she performed her part indeed without much graciousness  but mr <EOS> <EOS> 283.8514067310148
<SOS> <SOS> bennet was satisfied  and soon afterwards ordered her carriage <EOS> <EOS> 334.77871402078586
<SOS> <SOS> upon this signal  the youngest of her daughters put herself forward <EOS> <EOS> 376.3789250094875

<SOS> <SOS> she had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural self consequence  which the attentions of the officers  to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her  had increased into assurance <EOS> <EOS> 283.63240431917865
<SOS> <SOS> his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear <EOS> <EOS> 186.49887263916935
<SOS> <SOS> i am perfectly ready  i assure you  to keep my engagement  and when your sister is recovered  you shall if you please name the very day of the ball <EOS> <EOS> 172.51882780657934

<SOS> <SOS> the day passed much as the day before had done <EOS> <EOS> 176.48925097476902
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and missingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid  who continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room <EOS> <EOS> 217.09798486905666
<SOS> <SOS> the loo table  however  did not appear <EOS> <EOS> 322.2449144040406

<SOS> <SOS> it is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter  with ease  cannot write ill <EOS> <EOS> 338.59171727035925
<SOS> <SOS> that will not do for a compliment to darcy  caroline   cried her brother   because he does  not  write with ease <EOS> <EOS> 276.65666842802443

<SOS> <SOS> my style of writing is very different from yours <EOS> <EOS> 358.6725999107211
<SOS> <SOS> cried missingley   charles writes in the most careless way imaginable <EOS> <EOS> 382.30493859010807
<SOS> <SOS> my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them  by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents <EOS> <EOS> 240.05808390951765
<SOS> <SOS> nothing is more deceitful   said darcy   than the appearance of humility <EOS> <EOS> 266.18723524892386
<SOS> <SOS> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric  of compliment to yourself  and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone  and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <EOS> <EOS> 246.7148436332602
<SOS> <SOS> and yet  upon my honour  i believed what i said of myself to be true  and i believe it at this moment <EOS> <EOS> 154.02062028449723
<SOS> <SOS> i dare say you believed it  but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity <EOS> <EOS> 98.59032697697552
<SOS> <SOS> your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know  and if  as you were mounting your horse  a friend were to say   bingley  you had better stay till next week   you would probably do it  you would probably not go  and  at another word  might stay a month <EOS> <EOS> 286.78236384737613
<SOS> <SOS> i am exceedingly gratified   said bingley   by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper <EOS> <EOS> 214.10248909201707
<SOS> <SOS> but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend  for he would certainly think the better of me  if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial  and ride off as fast as i could <EOS> <EOS> 209.40878896258133
<SOS> <SOS> would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it <EOS> <EOS> 121.5530991946869
<SOS> <SOS> upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must speak for himself <EOS> <EOS> 531.9303624358498
<SOS> <SOS> to yield readily  easily  to the  persuasion  of a friend is no merit with you <EOS> <EOS> 212.83090554390932
<SOS> <SOS> to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either <EOS> <EOS> 241.83248749644815
<SOS> <SOS> you appear to me  mr darcy  to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection <EOS> <EOS> 127.49519910878125
<SOS> <SOS> a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request  without waiting for arguments to reason one into it <EOS> <EOS> 332.2322862562352
<SOS> <SOS> i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley <EOS> <EOS> 119.68460357094247
<SOS> <SOS> we may as well wait  perhaps  till the circumstance occurs  before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon <EOS> <EOS> 433.68148744367346
<SOS> <SOS> i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow  in comparison with myself  i should not pay him half so much deference <EOS> <EOS> 206.96961915494015
<SOS> <SOS> i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy  on particular occasions  and in particular places  at his own house especially  and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do <EOS> <EOS> 194.32621867194905
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy smiled  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh <EOS> <EOS> 220.08575621425445
<SOS> <SOS> i see your design  bingley   said his friend <EOS> <EOS> 161.65390527999728
<SOS> <SOS> you dislike an argument  and want to silence this <EOS> <EOS> 283.93603522246855
<SOS> <SOS> arguments are too much like disputes <EOS> <EOS> 368.3795134242531
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter <EOS> <EOS> 184.65657269953644
<SOS> <SOS> when that business was over  he applied to missingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music <EOS> <EOS> 189.9311682229827
<SOS> <SOS> missingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte  and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way  which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived  she seated herself <EOS> <EOS> 324.2477024048755
<SOS> <SOS> hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr darcy s eyes were fixed on her <EOS> <EOS> 269.2764924550669
<SOS> <SOS> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still more strange <EOS> <EOS> 180.91057342529334
<SOS> <SOS> she could only imagine however at last  that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in any other person present <EOS> <EOS> 293.8551245072249
<SOS> <SOS> the supposition did not pain her <EOS> <EOS> 150.41267708692652
<SOS> <SOS> she liked him too little to care for his approbation <EOS> <EOS> 180.74879613297205
<SOS> <SOS> after playing some italian songs  missingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air  and soon afterwards mr darcy  drawing near elizabeth  said to her    do not you feel a great inclination  missennet  to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel <EOS> <EOS> 327.9411619727531
<SOS> <SOS> she smiled  but made no answer <EOS> <EOS> 260.185517662097
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> said she   i heard you before  but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply <EOS> <EOS> 162.6680974322386
<SOS> <SOS> you wanted me  i know  to say  yes   that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste  but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt <EOS> <EOS> 178.05640850783578
<SOS> <SOS> i have therefore made up my mind to tell you  that i do not want to dance a reel at all  and now despise me if you dare <EOS> <EOS> 168.73682925051435
<SOS> <SOS> indeed i do not dare <EOS> <EOS> 116.42218879508292
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at his gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody  and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her <EOS> <EOS> 158.44694232590246
<SOS> <SOS> missingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane  received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 255.09009481146163
<SOS> <SOS> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest  by talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in such an alliance <EOS> <EOS> 314.7991598371238
<SOS> <SOS> and  if i may mention so delicate a subject  endeavour to check that little something  bordering on conceit and impertinence  which your lady possesses <EOS> <EOS> 377.3406107579363
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley <EOS> <EOS> 251.55540822509542
<SOS> <SOS> put them next to your great uncle the judge <EOS> <EOS> 434.3604149365287
<SOS> <SOS> they are in the same profession  you know  only in different lines <EOS> <EOS> 247.44398801548172
<SOS> <SOS> as for your elizabeth s picture  you must not attempt to have it taken  for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes <EOS> <EOS> 273.2309758076429
<SOS> <SOS> it would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but their colour and shape  and the eye lashes  so remarkably fine  might be copied <EOS> <EOS> 226.42332651980138
<SOS> <SOS> at that moment they were met from another walk  by mr <EOS> <EOS> 297.88664207566603
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and elizabeth herself <EOS> <EOS> 190.63519943863457
<SOS> <SOS> i did not know that you intended to walk   said missingley  in some confusion  lest they had been overheard <EOS> <EOS> 189.51379748878898
<SOS> <SOS> you used us abominably ill   answered mr <EOS> <EOS> 1075.0922762416626
<SOS> <SOS> hurst   in running away without telling us that you were coming out <EOS> <EOS> 424.52427262484224
<SOS> <SOS> then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy  she left elizabeth to walk by herself <EOS> <EOS> 181.8166634692158
<SOS> <SOS> the path just admitted three <EOS> <EOS> 468.9666650772965
<SOS> <SOS> we had better go into the avenue <EOS> <EOS> 124.54801663052731
<SOS> <SOS> you are charmingly group d  and appear to uncommon advantage <EOS> <EOS> 452.55065581844656
<SOS> <SOS> she then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the hope of being at home again in a day or two <EOS> <EOS> 225.73796454059692
<SOS> <SOS> jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening <EOS> <EOS> 252.16166603780843
<SOS> <SOS> when the ladies removed after dinner  elizabeth ran up to her sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into the drawing room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared <EOS> <EOS> 251.713977436748
<SOS> <SOS> their powers of conversation were considerable <EOS> <EOS> 290.2347099963386
<SOS> <SOS> but when the gentlemen entered  jane was no longer the first object <EOS> <EOS> 213.8424057894147
<SOS> <SOS> the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she should suffer from the change of room  and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place  that she might be farther from the door <EOS> <EOS> 167.87676648738238
<SOS> <SOS> he then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to any one else <EOS> <EOS> 265.50546733924426
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with great delight <EOS> <EOS> 255.6312691045349
<SOS> <SOS> when tea was over  mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table  but in vain <EOS> <EOS> 306.01923274336593
<SOS> <SOS> she assured him that no one intended to play  and the silence of the whole party on the subject  seemed to justify her <EOS> <EOS> 144.90527869141854
<SOS> <SOS> mr hurst had therefore nothing to do  but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep <EOS> <EOS> 142.93671447555155
<SOS> <SOS> darcy took up a book  missingley did the same  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 540.9563549344872
<SOS> <SOS> hurst  principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings  joined now and then in her brother s conversation with missennet <EOS> <EOS> 239.0024945887076
<SOS> <SOS> at length  quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book  which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his  she gave a great yawn and said   how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way <EOS> <EOS> 182.35376284057858
<SOS> <SOS> i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading <EOS> <EOS> 370.2011887012608
<SOS> <SOS> when i have a house of my own  i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library <EOS> <EOS> 86.92054904215877
<SOS> <SOS> no one made any reply <EOS> <EOS> 267.9619027884848
<SOS> <SOS> she then yawned again  threw aside her book  and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement  when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to missennet  she turned suddenly towards him and said   by the bye  charles  are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 482.7456149331721
<SOS> <SOS> i would advise you  before you determine on it  to consult the wishes of the present party  i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure <EOS> <EOS> 192.79868011251224
<SOS> <SOS> if you mean darcy   cried her brother   he may go to bed  if he chuses  before it begins  but as for the ball  it is quite a settled thing  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards <EOS> <EOS> 365.72648951931603
<SOS> <SOS> i should like balls infinitely better   she replied   if they were carried on in a different manner  but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting <EOS> <EOS> 198.68644005270454
<SOS> <SOS> it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day <EOS> <EOS> 252.76495443551394
<SOS> <SOS> much more rational  my dear caroline  i dare say  but it would not be near so much like a ball <EOS> <EOS> 204.35220411575676
<SOS> <SOS> missingley made no answer  and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room <EOS> <EOS> 288.2526006170973
<SOS> <SOS> her figure was elegant  and she walked well   but darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly studious <EOS> <EOS> 145.31240019067366
<SOS> <SOS> i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude <EOS> <EOS> 163.02616574887162
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately <EOS> <EOS> 240.99429915114965
<SOS> <SOS> missingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  mr darcy looked up <EOS> <EOS> 210.25232085935426
<SOS> <SOS> he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously closed his book <EOS> <EOS> 225.8282047861609
<SOS> <SOS> what could he mean <EOS> <EOS> 175.32384349470985
<SOS> <SOS> she was dying to know what could be his meaning   and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him <EOS> <EOS> 142.18326122931396
<SOS> <SOS> not at all   was her answer   but depend upon it  he means to be severe on us  and our surest way of disappointing him  will be to ask nothing about it <EOS> <EOS> 252.42474501935325
<SOS> <SOS> missingley  however  was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives <EOS> <EOS> 184.53539378965874
<SOS> <SOS> i have not the smallest objection to explaining them   said he  as soon as she allowed him to speak <EOS> <EOS> 129.07307559906258
<SOS> <SOS> you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss  or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking   if the first  i should be completely in your way   and if the second  i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire <EOS> <EOS> 303.64132424351027
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583

<SOS> <SOS> i dearly love a laugh <EOS> <EOS> 296.4306542550521
<SOS> <SOS> missingley   said he   has given me credit for more than can be <EOS> <EOS> 247.37597953389047
<SOS> <SOS> certainly   replied elizabeth   there are such people  but i hope i am not one of  them <EOS> <EOS> 154.8312453966073
<SOS> <SOS> i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good <EOS> <EOS> 218.12117862829018

<SOS> <SOS> but these  i suppose  are precisely what you are without <EOS> <EOS> 153.67141018486194
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps that is not possible for any one <EOS> <EOS> 150.19065362872382
<SOS> <SOS> but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule <EOS> <EOS> 224.84678157634394
<SOS> <SOS> such as vanity and pride <EOS> <EOS> 245.31684059348328
<SOS> <SOS> yes  vanity is a weakness indeed <EOS> <EOS> 333.5841501496367
<SOS> <SOS> but pride  where there is a real superiority of mind  pride will be always under good regulation <EOS> <EOS> 210.29336517229126
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth turned away to hide a smile <EOS> <EOS> 286.03820727869345
<SOS> <SOS> your examination of mr darcy is over  i presume   said missingley    and pray what is the result <EOS> <EOS> 195.0312726619788
<SOS> <SOS> i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect <EOS> <EOS> 101.86125593181818

<SOS> <SOS> bennet  who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday  which would exactly finish jane s week  could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before <EOS> <EOS> 353.8600049062813
<SOS> <SOS> her answer  therefore  was not propitious  at least not to elizabeth s wishes  for she was impatient to get home <EOS> <EOS> 206.1918223367132
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822

<SOS> <SOS> against staying longer  however  elizabeth was positively resolved  nor did she much expect it would be asked  and fearful  on the contrary  as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long  she urged jane to borrow mr bingley s carriage immediately  and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned  and the request made <EOS> <EOS> 408.68892864393604
<SOS> <SOS> missingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other <EOS> <EOS> 179.56640543049966
<SOS> <SOS> the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade missennet that it would not be safe for her  that she was not enough recovered  but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right <EOS> <EOS> 164.68485350965372
<SOS> <SOS> she attracted him more than he liked  and missingley was uncivil to  her   and more teazing than usual to himself <EOS> <EOS> 265.51317502158764
<SOS> <SOS> he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should  now  escape him  nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity  sensible that if such an idea had been suggested  his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it <EOS> <EOS> 276.3127379251156
<SOS> <SOS> missingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly  as well as her affection for jane  and when they parted  after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield  and embracing her most tenderly  she even shook hands with the former <EOS> <EOS> 250.8055829929737

<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet s expectations were fully answered <EOS> <EOS> 195.21425149961243

<SOS> <SOS> a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his authority as a clergyman  and his rights as a rector  made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self importance and humility <EOS> <EOS> 199.43382761606404

<SOS> <SOS> at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes  to have attention for any one in particular <EOS> <EOS> 334.7807139586065
<SOS> <SOS> allowing for the common demands of the game  mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told  the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 104.11492556414332
<SOS> <SOS> she dared not even mention that gentleman <EOS> <EOS> 296.48290236185943
<SOS> <SOS> her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved <EOS> <EOS> 339.577011061399
<SOS> <SOS> mr wickham began the subject himself <EOS> <EOS> 166.33760916073803
<SOS> <SOS> he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her answer  asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there <EOS> <EOS> 229.8046932277523

<SOS> <SOS> a clear ten thousand per annum <EOS> <EOS> 865.6339995032243
<SOS> <SOS> you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself  for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy <EOS> <EOS> 213.9290029792613
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could not but look surprised <EOS> <EOS> 284.9368427777283
<SOS> <SOS> you may well be surprised  missennet  at such an assertion  after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday <EOS> <EOS> 370.2296876630775
<SOS> <SOS> are you much acquainted with mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 136.6646261904717

<SOS> <SOS> i have no right to give  my  opinion   said wickham   as to his being agreeable or otherwise <EOS> <EOS> 151.06234096007833

<SOS> <SOS> wickham only shook his head <EOS> <EOS> 333.2642421314843
<SOS> <SOS> i wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking   whether he is likely to be in this country much longer <EOS> <EOS> 182.44583123755217
<SOS> <SOS> i do not at all know  but i  heard  nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 119.32420758145827
<SOS> <SOS> i hope your plans in favour of the     shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood <EOS> <EOS> 160.05558119886504
<SOS> <SOS> if  he  wishes to avoid seeing  me   he must go <EOS> <EOS> 253.01063020209824
<SOS> <SOS> we are not on friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but i have no reason for avoiding  him  but what i might proclaim to all the world  a sense of very great ill usage  and most painful regrets at his being what he is <EOS> <EOS> 200.63777871567783
<SOS> <SOS> his father  missennet  the late mr darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed  and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections <EOS> <EOS> 174.51624714583113
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry <EOS> <EOS> 238.09826604067206
<SOS> <SOS> mr wickham began to speak on more general topics  meryton  the neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter especially  with gentle but very intelligible gallantry <EOS> <EOS> 341.6744579989405
<SOS> <SOS> it was the prospect of constant society  and good society   he added   which was my chief inducement to enter the     shire <EOS> <EOS> 278.4999910973666
<SOS> <SOS> society  i own  is necessary to me <EOS> <EOS> 271.9353887542531

<SOS> <SOS> i cannot do justice to his kindness <EOS> <EOS> 196.0585861171613
<SOS> <SOS> he meant to provide for me amply  and thought he had done it  but when the living fell  it was given elsewhere <EOS> <EOS> 216.93349706670963
<SOS> <SOS> cried elizabeth   but how could  that  be <EOS> <EOS> 176.14915402590404
<SOS> <SOS> how could his will be disregarded <EOS> <EOS> 164.23829363839914
<SOS> <SOS> there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law <EOS> <EOS> 117.1071455035785
<SOS> <SOS> i have a warm  unguarded temper  and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion  of  him  and  to  him  too freely <EOS> <EOS> 218.17111632036188
<SOS> <SOS> i can recal nothing worse <EOS> <EOS> 381.02580161805975

<SOS> <SOS> this is quite shocking <EOS> <EOS> 306.5017916473528

<SOS> <SOS> some time or other he  will  be  but it shall not be by  me <EOS> <EOS> 133.20583089125344
<SOS> <SOS> till i can forget his father  i can never defy or expose  him <EOS> <EOS> 269.55673391640175
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them <EOS> <EOS> 263.5173028865922
<SOS> <SOS> but what   said she  after a pause   can have been his motive <EOS> <EOS> 147.17599619759946
<SOS> <SOS> a thorough  determined dislike of me  a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy <EOS> <EOS> 429.90473113054713
<SOS> <SOS> i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this  though i have never liked him  i had not thought so very ill of him  i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general  but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such injustice  such inhumanity as this <EOS> <EOS> 157.4170373126001
<SOS> <SOS> his disposition must be dreadful <EOS> <EOS> 188.30947008376174

<SOS> <SOS> my  father began life in the profession which your uncle  mr philips  appears to do so much credit to  but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy  and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property <EOS> <EOS> 176.46989474836727
<SOS> <SOS> he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy  a most intimate  confidential friend <EOS> <EOS> 169.6680119532391
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance  and when immediately before my father s death  mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me  i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him   as of affection to myself <EOS> <EOS> 152.60210318661115

<SOS> <SOS> it  is  wonderful    replied wickham    for almost all his actions may be traced to pride   and pride has often been his best friend <EOS> <EOS> 283.8700359943623
<SOS> <SOS> it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling <EOS> <EOS> 355.56584197555105
<SOS> <SOS> but we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour to me  there were stronger impulses even than pride <EOS> <EOS> 235.73841243500922

<SOS> <SOS> not to appear to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities  or lose the influence of the pemberley house  is a powerful motive <EOS> <EOS> 194.7766710904732
<SOS> <SOS> he has also  brotherly  pride  which with  some  brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers <EOS> <EOS> 332.31467294351387

<SOS> <SOS> mr wickham s attention was caught  and after observing mr collins for a few moments  he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh <EOS> <EOS> 237.36975266956156

<SOS> <SOS> i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements <EOS> <EOS> 392.35684777751555

<SOS> <SOS> i am by no means of opinion  i assure you   said he   that a ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to respectable people  can have any evil tendency  and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening  and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours  misslizabeth  for the two first dances especially   a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause  and not to any disrespect for her <EOS> <EOS> 214.08360093776022

<SOS> <SOS> the idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more astonished than gratified herself  by this effect of her charms  it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to  her <EOS> <EOS> 243.4496876901913

<SOS> <SOS> but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy s pleasure in the bingleys  invitation to the officers  and though this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny  to whom lydia eagerly applied  and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before  and was not yet returned  adding  with a significant smile   i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now  if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here <EOS> <EOS> 229.66861014369456
<SOS> <SOS> this part of his intelligence  though unheard by lydia  was caught by elizabeth  and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just  every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment  that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make <EOS> <EOS> 268.6897507447138
<SOS> <SOS> she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned away with a degree of ill humour  which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley  whose blind partiality provoked her <EOS> <EOS> 224.00239289105707
<SOS> <SOS> but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour  and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not dwell long on her spirits  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas  whom she had not seen for a week  she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin  and to point him out to her particular notice <EOS> <EOS> 120.69131446617378
<SOS> <SOS> the two first dances  however  brought a return of distress  they were dances of mortification <EOS> <EOS> 338.2310787564459
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins  awkward and solemn  apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without being aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give <EOS> <EOS> 408.62775232422706
<SOS> <SOS> she danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of talking of wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked <EOS> <EOS> 184.24329613083628
<SOS> <SOS> he walked away again immediately  and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind  charlotte tried to console her <EOS> <EOS> 244.14201127564854
<SOS> <SOS> heaven forbid <EOS> <EOS> 505.8392137250886
<SOS> <SOS> to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate <EOS> <EOS> 305.76490031096495
<SOS> <SOS> do not wish me such an evil <EOS> <EOS> 198.38404734422937
<SOS> <SOS> when the dancing recommenced  however  and darcy approached to claim her hand  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence <EOS> <EOS> 217.74614851314809
<SOS> <SOS> they stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances  and at first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk  she made some slight observation on the dance <EOS> <EOS> 271.2674520907914
<SOS> <SOS> he replied  and was again silent <EOS> <EOS> 217.69656780694558
<SOS> <SOS> after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  it is  your  turn to say something now  mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 162.67942125937736
<SOS> <SOS> he smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said <EOS> <EOS> 202.11910246073904
<SOS> <SOS> very well <EOS> <EOS> 147.97665094026033
<SOS> <SOS> that reply will do for the present <EOS> <EOS> 134.24638712061795
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones <EOS> <EOS> 823.013353890235
<SOS> <SOS> sometimes <EOS> <EOS> 243.50247474940068
<SOS> <SOS> one must speak a little  you know <EOS> <EOS> 279.3517605449208
<SOS> <SOS> it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the advantage of  some   conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible <EOS> <EOS> 199.85308903138136
<SOS> <SOS> we are each of an unsocial  taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb <EOS> <EOS> 161.19233045278656
<SOS> <SOS> i must not decide on my own performance <EOS> <EOS> 127.41742469131331
<SOS> <SOS> he made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton <EOS> <EOS> 204.606821763457
<SOS> <SOS> the effect was immediate <EOS> <EOS> 142.19990879590324
<SOS> <SOS> a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on <EOS> <EOS> 294.9978604294132
<SOS> <SOS> darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the subject <EOS> <EOS> 314.75475559110885
<SOS> <SOS> at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room  but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner <EOS> <EOS> 248.22200120754746
<SOS> <SOS> allow me to say  however  that your fair partner does not disgrace you  and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable event  my dear missliza   glancing at her sister and bingley   shall take place <EOS> <EOS> 415.2712380654582
<SOS> <SOS> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane  who were dancing together <EOS> <EOS> 341.7597820808179
<SOS> <SOS> i do not think we were speaking at all <EOS> <EOS> 113.64535097174922
<SOS> <SOS> sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves <EOS> <EOS> 221.00542153603607
<SOS> <SOS> we have tried two or three subjects already without success  and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine <EOS> <EOS> 500.9899430572626
<SOS> <SOS> what think you of books <EOS> <EOS> 218.78573868220687
<SOS> <SOS> said he  smiling <EOS> <EOS> 170.24335231165122
<SOS> <SOS> books  oh <EOS> <EOS> 378.34606565044265
<SOS> <SOS> no <EOS> <EOS> 98.26228543149467
<SOS> <SOS> i am sure we never read the same  or not with the same feelings <EOS> <EOS> 166.9221458807942
<SOS> <SOS> we may compare our different opinions <EOS> <EOS> 409.4476808433278
<SOS> <SOS> said he  with a look of doubt <EOS> <EOS> 141.1471957490342
<SOS> <SOS> yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember hearing you once say  mr darcy  that you hardly ever forgave  that your resentment once created was unappeasable <EOS> <EOS> 367.47276624568696
<SOS> <SOS> you are very cautious  i suppose  as to its  being created <EOS> <EOS> 235.93908246220062
<SOS> <SOS> i am   said he  with a firm voice <EOS> <EOS> 139.60780119601057
<SOS> <SOS> and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice <EOS> <EOS> 264.77765436905133
<SOS> <SOS> it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first <EOS> <EOS> 344.99982612765785
<SOS> <SOS> merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she  endeavouring to shake off her gravity <EOS> <EOS> 232.6449488613256
<SOS> <SOS> and what is your success <EOS> <EOS> 133.1887775369269
<SOS> <SOS> i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that report may vary greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  missennet  that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either <EOS> <EOS> 325.0274631474029
<SOS> <SOS> but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another opportunity <EOS> <EOS> 166.50032814700336
<SOS> <SOS> i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly replied <EOS> <EOS> 267.57800906639125
<SOS> <SOS> she said no more  and they went down the other dance and parted in silence  on each side dissatisfied  though not to an equal degree  for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and directed all his anger against another <EOS> <EOS> 409.5369169938119
<SOS> <SOS> they had not long separated when missingley came towards her  and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her   so  missliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham <EOS> <EOS> 424.5008283852652
<SOS> <SOS> your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking me a thousand questions  and i find that the young man forgot to tell you  among his other communications  that he was the son of old wickham  the late mr darcy s steward <EOS> <EOS> 178.93054328672213
<SOS> <SOS> let me recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr darcy s using him ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has been always remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner <EOS> <EOS> 207.75784858448506
<SOS> <SOS> i do not know the particulars  but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned  and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way <EOS> <EOS> 146.62504110521377
<SOS> <SOS> his coming into the country at all  is a most insolent thing indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it <EOS> <EOS> 263.13308119574975
<SOS> <SOS> his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same   said elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward  and of  that   i can assure you  he informed me himself <EOS> <EOS> 166.39490011161465
<SOS> <SOS> i beg your pardon   replied missingley  turning away with a sneer <EOS> <EOS> 307.30642680234473
<SOS> <SOS> excuse my interference <EOS> <EOS> 350.4426745478998
<SOS> <SOS> it was kindly meant <EOS> <EOS> 238.72272713283218
<SOS> <SOS> insolent girl <EOS> <EOS> 499.0570183219958
<SOS> <SOS> said elizabeth to herself <EOS> <EOS> 117.49534292190036
<SOS> <SOS> she then sought her eldest sister  who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley <EOS> <EOS> 186.67001318965285
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for wickham  resentment against his enemies  and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness <EOS> <EOS> 219.64036153516741
<SOS> <SOS> i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s   what you have learnt about mr wickham <EOS> <EOS> 163.42514240359478
<SOS> <SOS> but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon <EOS> <EOS> 174.4124535369951
<SOS> <SOS> no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you <EOS> <EOS> 112.91288017882518
<SOS> <SOS> no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton <EOS> <EOS> 215.39270063027774
<SOS> <SOS> this account then is what he has received from mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 136.33445310232668
<SOS> <SOS> i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity   said elizabeth warmly   but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only <EOS> <EOS> 178.73345836520664
<SOS> <SOS> mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before <EOS> <EOS> 228.5308052832256
<SOS> <SOS> on their being joined by mr bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew to missucas  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied  before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery <EOS> <EOS> 178.0853546831093
<SOS> <SOS> i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness <EOS> <EOS> 168.34789534201346
<SOS> <SOS> how wonderfully these sort of things occur <EOS> <EOS> 609.46340608384
<SOS> <SOS> i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him  which i am now going to do  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before <EOS> <EOS> 182.59488512883755
<SOS> <SOS> my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology <EOS> <EOS> 490.2468858034458
<SOS> <SOS> indeed i am <EOS> <EOS> 90.39342276249383
<SOS> <SOS> i believe him to be lady catherine s  nephew <EOS> <EOS> 112.47103966382952
<SOS> <SOS> it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night <EOS> <EOS> 215.51647218487847
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination  and when she ceased speaking  replied thus   my dear misslizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding  but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom  provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained <EOS> <EOS> 236.8380800591312
<SOS> <SOS> you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty <EOS> <EOS> 217.27384495591488
<SOS> <SOS> pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself <EOS> <EOS> 419.24788404402506
<SOS> <SOS> it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man <EOS> <EOS> 145.7620377896585
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility <EOS> <EOS> 178.41865988314717
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and mr darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow  and moved another way <EOS> <EOS> 195.61394053494803
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins then returned to elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 108.03126961285847
<SOS> <SOS> i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied with my reception <EOS> <EOS> 112.4074895676613
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention <EOS> <EOS> 144.57418567696698
<SOS> <SOS> he answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid me the compliment of saying  that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily <EOS> <EOS> 174.7786964325542
<SOS> <SOS> it was really a very handsome thought <EOS> <EOS> 140.06817607140295
<SOS> <SOS> upon the whole  i am much pleased with him <EOS> <EOS> 158.02576915116293
<SOS> <SOS> as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as jane <EOS> <EOS> 207.9297808282331
<SOS> <SOS> she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she felt capable under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters <EOS> <EOS> 386.4141796340246
<SOS> <SOS> her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near her  lest she might hear too much <EOS> <EOS> 358.17066355592453
<SOS> <SOS> when they sat down to supper  therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas  freely  openly  and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley <EOS> <EOS> 308.14735948355207
<SOS> <SOS> it was an animating subject  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 117.44234936772904
<SOS> <SOS> bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match <EOS> <EOS> 354.91398652581614
<SOS> <SOS> it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her younger daughters  as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked <EOS> <EOS> 159.23773436535672
<SOS> <SOS> bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life <EOS> <EOS> 285.6606290843949
<SOS> <SOS> she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it <EOS> <EOS> 410.86961546444525
<SOS> <SOS> in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper  for to her inexpressible vexation  she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy  who sat opposite to them <EOS> <EOS> 170.6394687673682
<SOS> <SOS> what is mr darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him <EOS> <EOS> 66.12801281756056
<SOS> <SOS> i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing  he  may not like to hear <EOS> <EOS> 172.0727343972835
<SOS> <SOS> you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing <EOS> <EOS> 202.46029624570664
<SOS> <SOS> nothing that she could say  however  had any influence <EOS> <EOS> 221.3923719519386
<SOS> <SOS> her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone <EOS> <EOS> 229.9679409607573
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation <EOS> <EOS> 293.3591431979774
<SOS> <SOS> the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity <EOS> <EOS> 402.29559352244047
<SOS> <SOS> at length however mr <EOS> <EOS> 281.51719296769807
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had no more to say  and lady lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken <EOS> <EOS> 142.85689632121665
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth now began to revive <EOS> <EOS> 124.89123213423912
<SOS> <SOS> but not long was the interval of tranquillity  for when supper was over  singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the company <EOS> <EOS> 322.99909920380014
<SOS> <SOS> by many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance   but in vain  mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her  and she began her song <EOS> <EOS> 309.97570312724747
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of half a minute began another <EOS> <EOS> 254.10065441975703
<SOS> <SOS> mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display  her voice was weak  and her manner affected <EOS> <EOS> 331.7033750189851
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was in agonies <EOS> <EOS> 69.95819181153341
<SOS> <SOS> she looked at jane  to see how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to bingley <EOS> <EOS> 170.93548046269635
<SOS> <SOS> she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs of derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued however impenetrably grave <EOS> <EOS> 389.17378144311255
<SOS> <SOS> she looked at her father to entreat his interference  lest mary should be singing all night <EOS> <EOS> 369.1004117497291
<SOS> <SOS> he took the hint  and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud   that will do extremely well  child <EOS> <EOS> 460.2459655051937
<SOS> <SOS> you have delighted us long enough <EOS> <EOS> 336.01520442937084
<SOS> <SOS> let the other young ladies have time to exhibit <EOS> <EOS> 169.60469519359108
<SOS> <SOS> mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted  and elizabeth sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech  was afraid her anxiety had done no good <EOS> <EOS> 311.5195826130929
<SOS> <SOS> i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there are certainly other things to be attended to <EOS> <EOS> 155.81314100073706
<SOS> <SOS> the rector of a parish has much to do <EOS> <EOS> 144.2023752289641
<SOS> <SOS> in the first place  he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron <EOS> <EOS> 133.0245195239546
<SOS> <SOS> he must write his own sermons  and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible <EOS> <EOS> 207.7927484721151
<SOS> <SOS> i cannot acquit him of that duty  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family <EOS> <EOS> 206.41565090941276
<SOS> <SOS> many stared <EOS> <EOS> 352.44540863729804
<SOS> <SOS> many smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young man <EOS> <EOS> 384.9290331651711
<SOS> <SOS> to elizabeth it appeared  that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit  or finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed <EOS> <EOS> 190.93329711253838
<SOS> <SOS> that his two sisters and mr darcy  however  should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough  and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman  or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable <EOS> <EOS> 168.92364658554516
<SOS> <SOS> the rest of the evening brought her little amusement <EOS> <EOS> 136.63441094702375
<SOS> <SOS> she was teazed by mr collins  who continued most perseveringly by her side  and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again  put it out of her power to dance with others <EOS> <EOS> 127.18632390097795
<SOS> <SOS> he assured her that as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her  and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening <EOS> <EOS> 208.31402737691695
<SOS> <SOS> there was no arguing upon such a project <EOS> <EOS> 63.916645432410235
<SOS> <SOS> she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham  and rejoiced in it <EOS> <EOS> 76.69004803101528
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone  which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family <EOS> <EOS> 309.13406597388683
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822

<SOS> <SOS> bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements  new carriages and wedding clothes  she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield  in the course of three or four months <EOS> <EOS> 460.729875642921
<SOS> <SOS> the next day opened a new scene at longbourn <EOS> <EOS> 325.2247617548796

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction  and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down again  and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion <EOS> <EOS> 246.5392830526938

<SOS> <SOS> believe me  my dear misslizabeth  that your modesty  so far from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other perfections <EOS> <EOS> 305.0433394725402
<SOS> <SOS> you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there  not  been this little unwillingness  but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address <EOS> <EOS> 199.0651906610897
<SOS> <SOS> but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject  perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying  and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife  as i certainly did <EOS> <EOS> 204.47387205691226
<SOS> <SOS> secondly  that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness  and thirdly  which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier  that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness <EOS> <EOS> 233.56950828419068
<SOS> <SOS> on this subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford  between our pools at quadrille  while mr <EOS> <EOS> 318.44961779330566
<SOS> <SOS> a clergyman like you must marry <EOS> <EOS> 317.0642978511461

<SOS> <SOS> find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to hunsford  and i will visit her <EOS> <EOS> 166.2564689087122
<SOS> <SOS> allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair cousin  that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer <EOS> <EOS> 223.4124223775684
<SOS> <SOS> thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood  where i assure you there are many amiable young women <EOS> <EOS> 420.9811553852426
<SOS> <SOS> but the fact is  that being  as i am  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father   who  however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters  that the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the melancholy event takes place  which  however  as i have already said  may not be for several years <EOS> <EOS> 341.6590665094268
<SOS> <SOS> and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection <EOS> <EOS> 178.39611840633273
<SOS> <SOS> on that head  therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married <EOS> <EOS> 478.8292255879461
<SOS> <SOS> it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now <EOS> <EOS> 192.02680039884993
<SOS> <SOS> you are too hasty  sir   she cried <EOS> <EOS> 373.23190830329685
<SOS> <SOS> you forget that i have made no answer <EOS> <EOS> 149.40641597443937
<SOS> <SOS> let me do it without farther loss of time <EOS> <EOS> 444.36965883079716
<SOS> <SOS> accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me <EOS> <EOS> 281.16039689751113
<SOS> <SOS> i am not now to learn   replied mr collins  with a formal wave of the hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he first applies for their favour  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time <EOS> <EOS> 207.24248610757047
<SOS> <SOS> upon my word  sir   cried elizabeth   your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration <EOS> <EOS> 541.0989588338418
<SOS> <SOS> you could not make  me  happy  and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make  you  so <EOS> <EOS> 75.71980576796595
<SOS> <SOS> nay  were your friend lady catherine to know me  i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation <EOS> <EOS> 225.91251808352513
<SOS> <SOS> were it certain that lady catherine would think so   said mr collins very gravely   but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you <EOS> <EOS> 142.55150107278928
<SOS> <SOS> indeed  mr collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary <EOS> <EOS> 195.99271029125094
<SOS> <SOS> you must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment of believing what i say <EOS> <EOS> 192.9932089734171
<SOS> <SOS> in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any self reproach <EOS> <EOS> 359.74895790178755
<SOS> <SOS> this matter may be considered  therefore  as finally settled <EOS> <EOS> 491.79358315799874
<SOS> <SOS> and rising as she thus spoke  she would have quitted the room  had not mr collins thus addressed her   when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present  because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character <EOS> <EOS> 205.99880137261084
<SOS> <SOS> really  mr collins   cried elizabeth with some warmth   you puzzle me exceedingly <EOS> <EOS> 340.4857796948449
<SOS> <SOS> you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course <EOS> <EOS> 291.2568311162374
<SOS> <SOS> your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications <EOS> <EOS> 353.14814255233995
<SOS> <SOS> as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me  i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the usual practice of elegant females <EOS> <EOS> 241.68803916939646
<SOS> <SOS> i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man <EOS> <EOS> 163.89455447633642
<SOS> <SOS> i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely impossible <EOS> <EOS> 176.7679669373466
<SOS> <SOS> my feelings in every respect forbid it <EOS> <EOS> 279.07406873099643
<SOS> <SOS> can i speak plainer <EOS> <EOS> 222.29574645743034
<SOS> <SOS> do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you  but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart <EOS> <EOS> 407.2693198817558
<SOS> <SOS> you are uniformly charming <EOS> <EOS> 324.4872170550842
<SOS> <SOS> to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew  determined  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement  to apply to her father  whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive  and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female <EOS> <EOS> 298.5726406007587
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love  for mr <EOS> <EOS> 162.31380975826283
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure  and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview  with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character <EOS> <EOS> 213.5431190463538
<SOS> <SOS> this information  however  startled mr <EOS> <EOS> 630.6540793681941
<SOS> <SOS> bennet   she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared not to believe it  and could not help saying so <EOS> <EOS> 181.70950549983922
<SOS> <SOS> i will speak to her about it myself directly <EOS> <EOS> 243.94333697212994
<SOS> <SOS> pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried mr collins   but if she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state <EOS> <EOS> 293.34113910818894
<SOS> <SOS> if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit  perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me  because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not contribute much to my felicity <EOS> <EOS> 354.70040045900066
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  alarmed <EOS> <EOS> 389.221132931106

<SOS> <SOS> he scarcely ever spoke to her  and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself  were transferred for the rest of the day to missucas  whose civility in listening to him  was a seasonable relief to them all  and especially to her friend <EOS> <EOS> 122.12941830053107
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride <EOS> <EOS> 151.54695529938982
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it <EOS> <EOS> 201.85882715824917
<SOS> <SOS> he was always to have gone on saturday  and to saturday he still meant to stay <EOS> <EOS> 212.3914603315002
<SOS> <SOS> he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s  where his regret and vexation  and the concern of every body was well talked over <EOS> <EOS> 261.0299579434215
<SOS> <SOS> to elizabeth  however  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence  had  been self imposed <EOS> <EOS> 200.7031099568669
<SOS> <SOS> i found   said he   as the time drew near  that i had better not meet mr darcy   that to be in the same room  the same party with him for so many hours together  might be more than i could bear  and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself <EOS> <EOS> 222.60290108593085
<SOS> <SOS> she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a full discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn  and during the walk  he particularly attended to her <EOS> <EOS> 251.53765997223087
<SOS> <SOS> his accompanying them was a double advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother <EOS> <EOS> 208.11506181052945
<SOS> <SOS> soon after their return  a letter was delivered to missennet  it came from netherfield  and was opened immediately <EOS> <EOS> 309.09784257843137
<SOS> <SOS> jane recollected herself soon  and putting the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs <EOS> <EOS> 441.6716714440089
<SOS> <SOS> the whole party have left netherfield by this time  and are on their way to town  and without any intention of coming back again <EOS> <EOS> 257.53008520588384
<SOS> <SOS> you shall hear what she says <EOS> <EOS> 215.52900886567923
<SOS> <SOS> she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly  and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street  where mr hurst had a house <EOS> <EOS> 342.5700466620703
<SOS> <SOS> the next was in these words <EOS> <EOS> 180.63933576718324
<SOS> <SOS> i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  but we will hope at some future period  to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known  and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence <EOS> <EOS> 349.79522454094575
<SOS> <SOS> i depend on you for that <EOS> <EOS> 137.13394016607745
<SOS> <SOS> it is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country <EOS> <EOS> 132.18436664768535
<SOS> <SOS> but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which missingley looks forward  may arrive earlier than she is aware  and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends  will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters <EOS> <EOS> 460.0993011393667
<SOS> <SOS> i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three  of whom we shall deprive you <EOS> <EOS> 189.81380736373262
<SOS> <SOS> it is evident by this   added jane   that he comes back no more this winter <EOS> <EOS> 289.327919793013
<SOS> <SOS> it is only evident that missingley does not mean he  should <EOS> <EOS> 184.6510492518215
<SOS> <SOS> why will you think so <EOS> <EOS> 169.27531016653376
<SOS> <SOS> he is his own master <EOS> <EOS> 116.37570937029676
<SOS> <SOS> but you do not know  all <EOS> <EOS> 76.46284786773403
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy is impatient to see his sister  and to confess the truth   we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again <EOS> <EOS> 158.74680580402745
<SOS> <SOS> i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  and accomplishments  and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself  is heightened into something still more interesting  from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister <EOS> <EOS> 425.70427798616555
<SOS> <SOS> i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject  but i will not leave the country without confiding them  and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable <EOS> <EOS> 181.47139400341896
<SOS> <SOS> what think you of  this  sentence  my dear lizzy <EOS> <EOS> 175.49136004449386
<SOS> <SOS> said jane as she finished it <EOS> <EOS> 117.88037270033482
<SOS> <SOS> is it not clear enough <EOS> <EOS> 350.3652210795597
<SOS> <SOS> does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister  that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him  she means  most kindly <EOS> <EOS> 178.98386318170765
<SOS> <SOS> can there be any other opinion on the subject <EOS> <EOS> 148.52934995016716
<SOS> <SOS> most willingly <EOS> <EOS> 312.5423715810001
<SOS> <SOS> you shall have it in few words <EOS> <EOS> 195.46948068438167
<SOS> <SOS> missingley sees that her brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry missarcy <EOS> <EOS> 218.1800383552837
<SOS> <SOS> she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you <EOS> <EOS> 149.59408521657434
<SOS> <SOS> jane shook her head <EOS> <EOS> 286.1626431668947
<SOS> <SOS> no one who has ever seen you together  can doubt his affection <EOS> <EOS> 377.1465531282185
<SOS> <SOS> she is not such a simpleton <EOS> <EOS> 89.64174098153258
<SOS> <SOS> could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself  she would have ordered her wedding clothes <EOS> <EOS> 200.27520028519095
<SOS> <SOS> but the case is this <EOS> <EOS> 112.19474051230235
<SOS> <SOS> we are not rich enough  or grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get missarcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been  one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and i dare say it would succeed  if misse bourgh were out of the way <EOS> <EOS> 217.31819543048735
<SOS> <SOS> but  my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because missingley tells you her brother greatly admires missarcy  he is in the smallest degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you  he is very much in love with her friend <EOS> <EOS> 257.7893407567181
<SOS> <SOS> if we thought alike of missingley   replied jane   your representation of all this  might make me quite easy <EOS> <EOS> 393.88786153820297
<SOS> <SOS> but i know the foundation is unjust <EOS> <EOS> 178.477129428226
<SOS> <SOS> that is right <EOS> <EOS> 174.56208343414937
<SOS> <SOS> you could not have started a more happy idea  since you will not take comfort in mine <EOS> <EOS> 220.5557676972217
<SOS> <SOS> believe her to be deceived by all means <EOS> <EOS> 180.32748306041918
<SOS> <SOS> you have now done your duty by her  and must fret no longer <EOS> <EOS> 226.84787705802304
<SOS> <SOS> you must decide for yourself   said elizabeth   and if upon mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife  i advise you by all means to refuse him <EOS> <EOS> 208.88729560453407
<SOS> <SOS> how can you talk so <EOS> <EOS> 220.77118586929473
<SOS> <SOS> said jane faintly smiling    you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation  i could not hesitate <EOS> <EOS> 193.40789180307814
<SOS> <SOS> but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be required <EOS> <EOS> 287.60082358983766
<SOS> <SOS> a thousand things may arise in six months <EOS> <EOS> 623.0582602505946
<SOS> <SOS> it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken  could influence a young man so totally independent of every one <EOS> <EOS> 329.20500500432627
<SOS> <SOS> she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect <EOS> <EOS> 193.58265649085223
<SOS> <SOS> jane s temper was not desponding  and she was gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope  that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart <EOS> <EOS> 214.5851468348289
<SOS> <SOS> bennet should only hear of the departure of the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away  just as they were all getting so intimate together <EOS> <EOS> 284.59935740794134
<SOS> <SOS> after lamenting it however at some length  she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that  though he had been invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two full courses <EOS> <EOS> 190.6175705723175
<SOS> <SOS> chapter xxii <EOS> <EOS> 144.20064122673648
<SOS> <SOS> the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases  and again during the chief of the day  was missucas so kind as to listen to mr collins <EOS> <EOS> 148.07697349872387
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her <EOS> <EOS> 190.08816265286654
<SOS> <SOS> it keeps him in good humour   said she   and i am more obliged to you than i can express <EOS> <EOS> 162.28945126263355
<SOS> <SOS> charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time <EOS> <EOS> 175.99583774255555
<SOS> <SOS> this was very amiable  but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of   its object was nothing less  than to secure her from any return of mr collins s addresses  by engaging them towards herself <EOS> <EOS> 278.5601918188914
<SOS> <SOS> but here  she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness  and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet <EOS> <EOS> 222.25467087181187
<SOS> <SOS> missucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane <EOS> <EOS> 337.1460215964303
<SOS> <SOS> but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there <EOS> <EOS> 140.52674883933295
<SOS> <SOS> in as short a time as mr collins s long speeches would allow  every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  and as they entered the house  he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present  the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness <EOS> <EOS> 188.01583638520404
<SOS> <SOS> the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature  must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and missucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment were gained <EOS> <EOS> 389.75661116887613
<SOS> <SOS> sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity <EOS> <EOS> 262.6419411610807
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter  to whom they could give little fortune  and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair <EOS> <EOS> 291.6205620162879
<SOS> <SOS> lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before  how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion  that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st <EOS> <EOS> 293.6048695994104
<SOS> <SOS> james s <EOS> <EOS> 193.70037757906493
<SOS> <SOS> the younger girls formed hopes of  coming out  a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid <EOS> <EOS> 596.7548968986969
<SOS> <SOS> charlotte herself was tolerably composed <EOS> <EOS> 436.3336753598575
<SOS> <SOS> she had gained her point  and had time to consider of it <EOS> <EOS> 137.31137606997868
<SOS> <SOS> her reflections were in general satisfactory <EOS> <EOS> 228.2309820504887
<SOS> <SOS> but still he would be her husband <EOS> <EOS> 146.28674734921506
<SOS> <SOS> without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony  marriage had always been her object  it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune  and however uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest preservative from want <EOS> <EOS> 653.0872043912201
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth would wonder  and probably would blame her  and though her resolution was not to be shaken  her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation <EOS> <EOS> 270.79900381620723
<SOS> <SOS> she resolved to give her the information herself  and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family <EOS> <EOS> 143.2823482702292
<SOS> <SOS> a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence  burst forth in such very direct questions on his return  as required some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising great self denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous love <EOS> <EOS> 309.262692924204
<SOS> <SOS> as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 237.02859507710076
<SOS> <SOS> they were all astonished  and mr bennet  who could by no means wish for so speedy a return  immediately said   but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here  my good sir <EOS> <EOS> 309.52870722631536
<SOS> <SOS> you had better neglect your relations  than run the risk of offending your patroness <EOS> <EOS> 398.29631836893924
<SOS> <SOS> you cannot be too much on your guard <EOS> <EOS> 142.70703365468444
<SOS> <SOS> risk any thing rather than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again  which i should think exceedingly probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence <EOS> <EOS> 379.07507106198864
<SOS> <SOS> believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this  as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire <EOS> <EOS> 352.04979742769683
<SOS> <SOS> as for my fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness  not excepting my cousin elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 328.7331584975365
<SOS> <SOS> with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return <EOS> <EOS> 402.33451361156176
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls  and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him <EOS> <EOS> 210.3330930741804
<SOS> <SOS> she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s  he might become a very agreeable companion <EOS> <EOS> 303.3301810166672
<SOS> <SOS> missucas called soon after breakfast  and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before <EOS> <EOS> 245.14953526490302
<SOS> <SOS> the possibility of mr collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two  but that charlotte could encourage him  seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself  and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out   engaged to mr collins <EOS> <EOS> 190.88868836182215
<SOS> <SOS> my dear charlotte   impossible <EOS> <EOS> 176.89286940536437
<SOS> <SOS> the steady countenance which missucas had commanded in telling her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected  she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied   why should you be surprised  my dear eliza <EOS> <EOS> 391.88072562367626
<SOS> <SOS> do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with you <EOS> <EOS> 113.71932247226563
<SOS> <SOS> i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte    you must be surprised  very much surprised   so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you <EOS> <EOS> 185.14345915718036
<SOS> <SOS> but when you have had time to think it all over  i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done <EOS> <EOS> 84.16148058137198
<SOS> <SOS> i am not romantic you know <EOS> <EOS> 60.033442161857515
<SOS> <SOS> i ask only a comfortable home  and considering mr collins s character  connections  and situation in life  i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair  as most people can boast on entering the marriage state <EOS> <EOS> 300.0676650719835
<SOS> <SOS> charlotte did not stay much longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard <EOS> <EOS> 212.4308768645709
<SOS> <SOS> it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match <EOS> <EOS> 144.63545493291528
<SOS> <SOS> she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own  but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage <EOS> <EOS> 219.34557672886956
<SOS> <SOS> charlotte the wife of mr collins  was a most humiliating picture <EOS> <EOS> 125.06992025085141
<SOS> <SOS> and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen <EOS> <EOS> 149.51629839253872
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on what she had heard  and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family <EOS> <EOS> 206.1366025192204
<SOS> <SOS> with many compliments to them  and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter   to an audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for mr <EOS> <EOS> 369.57811126675864
<SOS> <SOS> do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy <EOS> <EOS> 175.937612560543
<SOS> <SOS> nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment  but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy <EOS> <EOS> 261.0248844843016
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters  by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william  in which she was readily joined by jane  and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match  the excellent character of mr collins  and the convenient distance of hunsford from london <EOS> <EOS> 208.17783634054584
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent <EOS> <EOS> 464.26052479625884
<SOS> <SOS> two inferences  however  were plainly deduced from the whole  one  that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief  and the other  that she herself had been barbarously used by them all  and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day <EOS> <EOS> 172.0953622743654
<SOS> <SOS> nothing could console and nothing appease her <EOS> <EOS> 199.9767622074104
<SOS> <SOS> nor did that day wear out her resentment <EOS> <EOS> 283.398063259393
<SOS> <SOS> a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude  and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter <EOS> <EOS> 399.69330532812205
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion  and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that charlotte lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his daughter <EOS> <EOS> 198.67268367699378
<SOS> <SOS> lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mr <EOS> <EOS> 224.95743018225258
<SOS> <SOS> bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was  though mr <EOS> <EOS> 422.4996845624199
<SOS> <SOS> bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away <EOS> <EOS> 394.41846217923836
<SOS> <SOS> between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again <EOS> <EOS> 285.2356850428101
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mr <EOS> <EOS> 224.1349212089619
<SOS> <SOS> bennet <EOS> <EOS> 221.34761884565685
<SOS> <SOS> it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome <EOS> <EOS> 201.69420655495696
<SOS> <SOS> she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent  and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable <EOS> <EOS> 267.8438501577698
<SOS> <SOS> such were the gentle murmurs of mr <EOS> <EOS> 207.12224705249392

<SOS> <SOS> neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject <EOS> <EOS> 342.85686784514405
<SOS> <SOS> day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly incensed mr <EOS> <EOS> 507.0865118948047
<SOS> <SOS> even elizabeth began to fear  not that bingley was indifferent  but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away <EOS> <EOS> 204.85418703842063
<SOS> <SOS> unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness  and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover  she could not prevent its frequently recurring <EOS> <EOS> 143.35682416515667
<SOS> <SOS> the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend  assisted by the attractions of missarcy and the amusements of london  might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his attachment <EOS> <EOS> 177.21954446766722
<SOS> <SOS> as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspence was  of course  more painful than elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing  and between herself and elizabeth  therefore  the subject was never alluded to <EOS> <EOS> 228.66885623172973
<SOS> <SOS> it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity <EOS> <EOS> 499.06237926197167
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight  but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction <EOS> <EOS> 213.22210700390258
<SOS> <SOS> he was too happy  however  to need much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company <EOS> <EOS> 245.50763893956685
<SOS> <SOS> the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge  and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed <EOS> <EOS> 217.26134846660557

<SOS> <SOS> she complained bitterly of all this to her husband <EOS> <EOS> 168.45628574434753
<SOS> <SOS> indeed  mr bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that i should be forced to make way for  her   and live to see her take my place in it <EOS> <EOS> 124.95997462340085

<SOS> <SOS> missingley s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt <EOS> <EOS> 392.00592223951315
<SOS> <SOS> the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter  and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country <EOS> <EOS> 184.23715912082318
<SOS> <SOS> hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter  she found little  except the professed affection of the writer  that could give her any comfort <EOS> <EOS> 237.5545871298677
<SOS> <SOS> missarcy s praise occupied the chief of it <EOS> <EOS> 284.9922326798575
<SOS> <SOS> her many attractions were again dwelt on  and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter <EOS> <EOS> 218.7628129783946
<SOS> <SOS> she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr darcy s house  and mentioned with raptures  some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture <EOS> <EOS> 197.8258649999154
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this  heard it in silent indignation <EOS> <EOS> 281.47785203882563
<SOS> <SOS> that he was really fond of jane  she doubted no more than she had ever done  and much as she had always been disposed to like him  she could not think without anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness of temper  that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends  and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations <EOS> <EOS> 177.40748958382048
<SOS> <SOS> had his own happiness  however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best  but her sister s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible himself <EOS> <EOS> 201.96463009909698

<SOS> <SOS> bennet s leaving them together  after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master  she could not help saying   oh <EOS> <EOS> 536.8392334347623
<SOS> <SOS> that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him <EOS> <EOS> 197.79047495092962

<SOS> <SOS> my dear jane  mr collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow minded  silly man  you know he is  as well as i do  and you must feel  as well as i do  that the woman who marries him  cannot have a proper way of thinking <EOS> <EOS> 162.83991088450213

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth soon heard from her friend  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been  that it should be equally unreserved was impossible <EOS> <EOS> 197.42746473586456

<SOS> <SOS> charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she would like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen <EOS> <EOS> 280.81264033058693
<SOS> <SOS> she wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with comforts  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise <EOS> <EOS> 283.6090781986664

<SOS> <SOS> her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is <EOS> <EOS> 462.2773318439617
<SOS> <SOS> she accounted for it  however  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn  had by some accident been lost <EOS> <EOS> 251.2691561000696

<SOS> <SOS> i was right  therefore  my last letter had never reached her <EOS> <EOS> 290.81995919170276

<SOS> <SOS> the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister  will prove what she felt <EOS> <EOS> 156.50039234583684

<SOS> <SOS> i need not explain myself farther  and      though  we  know this anxiety to be quite needless  yet if she      feels it  it will easily account for her behaviour to me  and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister  whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf  is natural and amiable <EOS> <EOS> 262.67004666123927

<SOS> <SOS> every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment  for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight <EOS> <EOS> 196.5479858012087

<SOS> <SOS> they were then  with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as soon as they were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode  and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment <EOS> <EOS> 228.10104990396948
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room  its aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself particularly to her  as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him <EOS> <EOS> 180.7478754248867
<SOS> <SOS> but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air  with such a companion <EOS> <EOS> 156.3689531321556
<SOS> <SOS> when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte <EOS> <EOS> 243.9253501947678

<SOS> <SOS> from his garden  mr collins would have led them round his two meadows  but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost  turned back  and while sir william accompanied him  charlotte took her sister and friend over the house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help <EOS> <EOS> 288.69856076828603
<SOS> <SOS> it was rather small  but well built and convenient  and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit <EOS> <EOS> 244.71194596869768
<SOS> <SOS> when mr collins could be forgotten  there was really a great air of comfort throughout  and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten <EOS> <EOS> 248.87357485480084

<SOS> <SOS> such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of living  quite frightened maria lucas  who had been little used to company  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings  with as much apprehension  as her father had done to his presentation at st <EOS> <EOS> 262.2985702094784

<SOS> <SOS> when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy  she turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment  at her being so thin  and so small <EOS> <EOS> 231.6047315829536

<SOS> <SOS> with three younger sisters grown up   replied elizabeth smiling   your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it <EOS> <EOS> 579.8322716024613
<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer  and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence <EOS> <EOS> 320.93685914342154
<SOS> <SOS> you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure   therefore you need not conceal your age <EOS> <EOS> 223.61170417744813

<SOS> <SOS> collins sat down to quadrille  and as misse bourgh chose to play at cassino  the two girls had the honour of assisting mr <EOS> <EOS> 354.42754156334115
<SOS> <SOS> jenkinson to make up her party <EOS> <EOS> 264.43709889997405
<SOS> <SOS> their table was superlatively stupid <EOS> <EOS> 205.9324247995036
<SOS> <SOS> scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game  except when mr <EOS> <EOS> 321.33539820530723
<SOS> <SOS> jenkinson expressed her fears of misse bourgh s being too hot or too cold  or having too much or too little light <EOS> <EOS> 640.6298740844884
<SOS> <SOS> a great deal more passed at the other table <EOS> <EOS> 206.17521489562137
<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine was generally speaking  stating the mistakes of the three others  or relating some anecdote of herself <EOS> <EOS> 376.8669083977776
<SOS> <SOS> mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said  thanking her for every fish he won  and apologising if he thought he won too many <EOS> <EOS> 283.131138540029
<SOS> <SOS> sir william did not say much <EOS> <EOS> 273.66386736270204
<SOS> <SOS> he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names <EOS> <EOS> 149.8040121989386
<SOS> <SOS> when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose  the tables were broke up  the carriage was offered to mr <EOS> <EOS> 235.6889500429045
<SOS> <SOS> collins  gratefully accepted  and immediately ordered <EOS> <EOS> 754.875470842683
<SOS> <SOS> from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins s side  and as many bows on sir william s  they departed <EOS> <EOS> 224.58587298550003
<SOS> <SOS> as soon as they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her cousin  to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings  which  for charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it really was <EOS> <EOS> 160.67900789121896
<SOS> <SOS> but her commendation  though costing her some trouble  could by no means satisfy mr collins  and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands <EOS> <EOS> 214.52485321564174
<SOS> <SOS> chapter vii <EOS> <EOS> 353.23667733394785
<SOS> <SOS> sir william staid only a week at hunsford  but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with <EOS> <EOS> 204.80947008669003
<SOS> <SOS> while sir william was with them  mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig  and shewing him the country  but when he went away  the whole family returned to their usual employments  and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden  or in reading and writing  and looking out of window in his own book room  which fronted the road <EOS> <EOS> 217.36877110512006
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use  it was a better sized room  and had a pleasanter aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did  for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally lively  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement <EOS> <EOS> 288.4643242228613
<SOS> <SOS> she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and had a few minutes  conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out <EOS> <EOS> 321.34715668485063
<SOS> <SOS> very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise  and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours <EOS> <EOS> 197.8417081103538
<SOS> <SOS> she examined into their employments  looked at their work  and advised them to do it differently  found fault with the arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mr <EOS> <EOS> 291.95972432218804
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county  she was a most active magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented or too poor  she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences  silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty <EOS> <EOS> 168.48224933265206
<SOS> <SOS> the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week  and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being only one card table in the evening  every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first <EOS> <EOS> 243.43230074193056
<SOS> <SOS> this however was no evil to elizabeth  and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte  and the weather was so fine for the time of year  that she had often great enjoyment out of doors <EOS> <EOS> 234.97217374109565
<SOS> <SOS> in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away <EOS> <EOS> 233.5614103482723
<SOS> <SOS> easter was approaching  and the week preceding it  was to bring an addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a circle must be important <EOS> <EOS> 269.4057110541626
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival  that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties  and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless missingley s designs on him were  by his behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration  and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by missucas and herself <EOS> <EOS> 233.78371618925343
<SOS> <SOS> his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park  hurried home with the great intelligence <EOS> <EOS> 286.218843555819
<SOS> <SOS> there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of his uncle  lord      and to the great surprise of all the party  when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him <EOS> <EOS> 172.29829242049507
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me <EOS> <EOS> 152.66642745192107

<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  paid his compliments  with his usual reserve  to mr <EOS> <EOS> 203.45008677263536
<SOS> <SOS> colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mr <EOS> <EOS> 457.3437783368571
<SOS> <SOS> collins  sat for some time without speaking to any body <EOS> <EOS> 299.773691225263
<SOS> <SOS> she answered him in the usual way  and after a moment s pause  added   my eldest sister has been in town these three months <EOS> <EOS> 249.2066736251017
<SOS> <SOS> have you never happened to see her there <EOS> <EOS> 158.82545731812155

<SOS> <SOS> his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged  for she did not scruple to call out   what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam <EOS> <EOS> 276.88470256103835

<SOS> <SOS> when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the instrument <EOS> <EOS> 296.70849751084313

<SOS> <SOS> i shall not say that you are mistaken   he replied   because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know  that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own <EOS> <EOS> 176.23106640991182
<SOS> <SOS> indeed  mr darcy  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire  and  give me leave to say  very impolitic too  for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such things may come out  as will shock your relations to hear <EOS> <EOS> 188.3766657169751
<SOS> <SOS> i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly <EOS> <EOS> 90.23507470333183

<SOS> <SOS> he danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce  and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner <EOS> <EOS> 405.83855264128823
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy  you cannot deny the fact <EOS> <EOS> 140.42562695960248

<SOS> <SOS> shall we ask him why a man of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers <EOS> <EOS> 319.4473992814297
<SOS> <SOS> i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying to him <EOS> <EOS> 324.971075939216
<SOS> <SOS> it is because he will not give himself the trouble <EOS> <EOS> 125.9581963094504
<SOS> <SOS> i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said darcy   of conversing easily with those i have never seen before <EOS> <EOS> 397.1878568339877

<SOS> <SOS> as she had heard no carriage  she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and to her very great surprise  mr darcy  and mr darcy only  entered the room <EOS> <EOS> 222.07447800929282
<SOS> <SOS> he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for his intrusion  by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within <EOS> <EOS> 234.5843047603404
<SOS> <SOS> they then sat down  and when her enquiries after rosings were made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence <EOS> <EOS> 510.57638839216185
<SOS> <SOS> it was absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in this emergence recollecting  when  she had seen him last in hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure  she observed   how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 232.04563632447628
<SOS> <SOS> it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he went but the day before <EOS> <EOS> 156.00849723574123

<SOS> <SOS> i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future <EOS> <EOS> 130.0339228496799
<SOS> <SOS> but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle <EOS> <EOS> 143.63573059382338
<SOS> <SOS> i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it up  as soon as any eligible purchase offers <EOS> <EOS> 182.85772844065642

<SOS> <SOS> but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very likely  even to charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do  which was the more probable from the time of year <EOS> <EOS> 222.88718879407048

<SOS> <SOS> they called at various times of the morning  sometimes separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by their aunt <EOS> <EOS> 331.9914952506275
<SOS> <SOS> it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which of course recommended him still more  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his evident admiration of her  of her former favourite george wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners  she believed he might have the best informed mind <EOS> <EOS> 284.29855157382815
<SOS> <SOS> but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more difficult to understand <EOS> <EOS> 148.59323625210502
<SOS> <SOS> it could not be for society  as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice  a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to himself <EOS> <EOS> 352.30044519317715
<SOS> <SOS> he seldom appeared really animated <EOS> <EOS> 654.8032875684218
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> she watched him whenever they were at rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford  but without much success <EOS> <EOS> 245.9201375033252
<SOS> <SOS> he certainly looked at her friend a great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable <EOS> <EOS> 156.99100482172494
<SOS> <SOS> it was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind <EOS> <EOS> 226.17566913562476
<SOS> <SOS> she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the idea  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 216.48024023151112
<SOS> <SOS> collins did not think it right to press the subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt  that all her friend s dislike would vanish  if she could suppose him to be in her power <EOS> <EOS> 193.1724526106514
<SOS> <SOS> in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam <EOS> <EOS> 432.6587653084275
<SOS> <SOS> he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin could have none at all <EOS> <EOS> 237.7582826363902
<SOS> <SOS> chapter x <EOS> <EOS> 360.5987644531657
<SOS> <SOS> she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  and to prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him at first  that it was a favourite haunt of hers <EOS> <EOS> 222.10060692863587
<SOS> <SOS> yet it did  and even a third <EOS> <EOS> 225.35094348766694
<SOS> <SOS> he never said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions  about her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of solitary walks  and her opinion of mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 265.6229113896484
<SOS> <SOS> collins s happiness  and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house  he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying  there  too <EOS> <EOS> 261.71615768380366
<SOS> <SOS> his words seemed to imply it <EOS> <EOS> 161.52149631990946
<SOS> <SOS> could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts <EOS> <EOS> 236.08978537630642
<SOS> <SOS> she supposed  if he meant any thing  he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter <EOS> <EOS> 317.25554527089827
<SOS> <SOS> it distressed her a little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage <EOS> <EOS> 169.27542796474924
<SOS> <SOS> she was engaged one day as she walked  in re perusing jane s last letter  and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by mr darcy  she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her <EOS> <EOS> 268.5966445496071
<SOS> <SOS> putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile  she said   i did not know before that you ever walked this way <EOS> <EOS> 206.2880550060265
<SOS> <SOS> are you going much farther <EOS> <EOS> 388.1000548789707
<SOS> <SOS> and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the parsonage together <EOS> <EOS> 326.9098986646554
<SOS> <SOS> do you certainly leave kent on saturday <EOS> <EOS> 563.6019529202265
<SOS> <SOS> yes  if darcy does not put it off again <EOS> <EOS> 289.239189010644
<SOS> <SOS> but i am at his disposal <EOS> <EOS> 92.86984329465197
<SOS> <SOS> and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice <EOS> <EOS> 204.34938970505232
<SOS> <SOS> he likes to have his own way very well   replied colonel fitzwilliam <EOS> <EOS> 242.7874550127526
<SOS> <SOS> but so we all do <EOS> <EOS> 239.4319665809404
<SOS> <SOS> i speak feelingly <EOS> <EOS> 170.6578715584566
<SOS> <SOS> in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little of either <EOS> <EOS> 230.3620867783578
<SOS> <SOS> now  seriously  what have you ever known of self denial and dependence <EOS> <EOS> 428.5122281187537
<SOS> <SOS> when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose  or procuring any thing you had a fancy for <EOS> <EOS> 369.9096908023738
<SOS> <SOS> these are home questions  and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature <EOS> <EOS> 227.42248179410464

<SOS> <SOS> younger sons cannot marry where they like <EOS> <EOS> 857.7733568354143
<SOS> <SOS> unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very often do <EOS> <EOS> 360.31424733736
<SOS> <SOS> our habits of expence make us too dependant  and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money <EOS> <EOS> 425.46611705091306
<SOS> <SOS> is this   thought elizabeth   meant for me <EOS> <EOS> 195.35755405356355
<SOS> <SOS> and she coloured at the idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   and pray  what is the usual price of an earl s younger son <EOS> <EOS> 295.79262079425524
<SOS> <SOS> unless the elder brother is very sickly  i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds <EOS> <EOS> 544.6775871473278
<SOS> <SOS> he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped <EOS> <EOS> 152.98254398666194
<SOS> <SOS> to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed  she soon afterwards said   i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal <EOS> <EOS> 317.62099410446507
<SOS> <SOS> i wonder he does not marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind <EOS> <EOS> 272.2145915724537
<SOS> <SOS> but  perhaps his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her <EOS> <EOS> 186.05622086379617
<SOS> <SOS> no   said colonel fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he must divide with me <EOS> <EOS> 230.60838193099252
<SOS> <SOS> are you  indeed <EOS> <EOS> 236.44348361108547
<SOS> <SOS> and pray what sort of guardians do you make <EOS> <EOS> 228.5708387030258
<SOS> <SOS> she directly replied   you need not be frightened <EOS> <EOS> 240.69769458967642
<SOS> <SOS> i never heard any harm of her  and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world <EOS> <EOS> 109.76719843622286
<SOS> <SOS> she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance  mr <EOS> <EOS> 175.9994818000161

<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> yes   said elizabeth drily   mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him <EOS> <EOS> 152.9217084127481
<SOS> <SOS> care of him <EOS> <EOS> 179.31568952392118
<SOS> <SOS> yes  i really believe darcy  does  take care of him in those points where he most wants care <EOS> <EOS> 529.7218148173637
<SOS> <SOS> from something that he told me in our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him <EOS> <EOS> 206.18152821102544
<SOS> <SOS> but i ought to beg his pardon  for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant <EOS> <EOS> 165.94083826873316
<SOS> <SOS> what is it you mean <EOS> <EOS> 138.17341135205825
<SOS> <SOS> you may depend upon my not mentioning it <EOS> <EOS> 273.6330172703356
<SOS> <SOS> what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any other particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer <EOS> <EOS> 258.59119159621423
<SOS> <SOS> did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference <EOS> <EOS> 175.87939529836083
<SOS> <SOS> i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady <EOS> <EOS> 202.57004255271264
<SOS> <SOS> and what arts did he use to separate them <EOS> <EOS> 275.92422334310163
<SOS> <SOS> he did not talk to me of his own arts   said fitzwilliam smiling <EOS> <EOS> 184.7002090320705
<SOS> <SOS> he only told me  what i have now told you <EOS> <EOS> 115.76507463746356
<SOS> <SOS> after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful <EOS> <EOS> 197.07593210474732
<SOS> <SOS> i am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she <EOS> <EOS> 85.68582109166873
<SOS> <SOS> your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings <EOS> <EOS> 333.54683612487156
<SOS> <SOS> why was he to be the judge <EOS> <EOS> 124.27184665979841
<SOS> <SOS> you are rather disposed to call his interference officious <EOS> <EOS> 318.27330030150694
<SOS> <SOS> i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgment alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy <EOS> <EOS> 171.55505213186345
<SOS> <SOS> but   she continued  recollecting herself   as we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him <EOS> <EOS> 212.14112065783388
<SOS> <SOS> that is not an unnatural surmise   said fitzwilliam   but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly <EOS> <EOS> 195.26750780545402
<SOS> <SOS> this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy  that she would not trust herself with an answer  and  therefore  abruptly changing the conversation  talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage <EOS> <EOS> 267.4374549961938
<SOS> <SOS> it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected <EOS> <EOS> 132.95105939853485
<SOS> <SOS> there could not exist in the world  two  men  over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence <EOS> <EOS> 140.42486605079017
<SOS> <SOS> that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane  she had never doubted  but she had always attributed to missingley the principal design and arrangement of them <EOS> <EOS> 142.11681379222912
<SOS> <SOS> if his own vanity  however  did not mislead him   he  was the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered  and still continued to suffer <EOS> <EOS> 181.40081730848294
<SOS> <SOS> to jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility of objection <EOS> <EOS> 175.1292567637141

<SOS> <SOS> neither could any thing be urged against my father  who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will probably never reach <EOS> <EOS> 382.82407602298775
<SOS> <SOS> when she thought of her mother indeed  her confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow that any objections  there  had material weight with mr darcy  whose pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections  than from their want of sense  and she was quite decided at last  that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride  and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister <EOS> <EOS> 210.55844918123023
<SOS> <SOS> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on a headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening that  added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy  it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to drink tea <EOS> <EOS> 256.1373581707636
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822

<SOS> <SOS> chapter xi <EOS> <EOS> 369.4567036044155
<SOS> <SOS> when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy  chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent <EOS> <EOS> 180.88852264607107
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness  with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal <EOS> <EOS> 207.97029321362754
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict  gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings <EOS> <EOS> 104.39158234531986
<SOS> <SOS> it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next  and a still greater  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits  by all that affection could do <EOS> <EOS> 186.3377051772153
<SOS> <SOS> she could not think of darcy s leaving kent  without remembering that his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as he was  she did not mean to be unhappy about him <EOS> <EOS> 158.55408211499406
<SOS> <SOS> but this idea was soon banished  and her spirits were very differently affected  when  to her utter amazement  she saw mr darcy walk into the room <EOS> <EOS> 238.02997193903812
<SOS> <SOS> in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health  imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better <EOS> <EOS> 207.28830735320676
<SOS> <SOS> she answered him with cold civility <EOS> <EOS> 237.2911962401957
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was surprised  but said not a word <EOS> <EOS> 172.24611080711665
<SOS> <SOS> after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner  and thus began   in vain have i struggled <EOS> <EOS> 390.8774888722584
<SOS> <SOS> it will not do <EOS> <EOS> 76.91005559596078

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression <EOS> <EOS> 283.54086906682505
<SOS> <SOS> this he considered sufficient encouragement  and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her  immediately followed <EOS> <EOS> 237.40882537171873
<SOS> <SOS> in spite of her deeply rooted dislike  she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection  and though her intentions did not vary for an instant  she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive  till  roused to resentment by his subsequent language  she lost all compassion in anger <EOS> <EOS> 182.97873604781276
<SOS> <SOS> he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in spite of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer  and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand <EOS> <EOS> 170.4582299092504
<SOS> <SOS> as he said this  she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer <EOS> <EOS> 122.71696807929358
<SOS> <SOS> he  spoke  of apprehension and anxiety  but his countenance expressed real security <EOS> <EOS> 443.84859928795095
<SOS> <SOS> such a circumstance could only exasperate farther  and when he ceased  the colour rose into her cheeks  and she said   in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however unequally they may be returned <EOS> <EOS> 324.14267304684716
<SOS> <SOS> it is natural that obligation should be felt  and if i could  feel  gratitude  i would now thank you <EOS> <EOS> 233.0274719260166
<SOS> <SOS> it has been most unconsciously done  however  and i hope will be of short duration <EOS> <EOS> 216.05694902277472
<SOS> <SOS> the feelings which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation <EOS> <EOS> 226.17439453137882
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy  who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise <EOS> <EOS> 275.9778828068104
<SOS> <SOS> his complexion became pale with anger  and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature <EOS> <EOS> 212.22416279120483
<SOS> <SOS> the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful <EOS> <EOS> 171.13361242238258
<SOS> <SOS> i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so little  endeavour  at civility  i am thus rejected <EOS> <EOS> 314.8040760322819
<SOS> <SOS> but it is of small importance <EOS> <EOS> 189.50371552545812

<SOS> <SOS> had not my own feelings decided against you  had they been indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man  who has been the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most beloved sister <EOS> <EOS> 264.3015043040634
<SOS> <SOS> i have every reason in the world to think ill of you <EOS> <EOS> 113.57348450523409

<SOS> <SOS> you dare not  you cannot deny that you have been the principal  if not the only means of dividing them from each other  of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind <EOS> <EOS> 195.72272657230207
<SOS> <SOS> she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse <EOS> <EOS> 229.78230261496768
<SOS> <SOS> he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity <EOS> <EOS> 259.31263327967207
<SOS> <SOS> can you deny that you have done it <EOS> <EOS> 121.60783455585977

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection  but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to conciliate her <EOS> <EOS> 277.64307900416486

<SOS> <SOS> on this subject  what can you have to say <EOS> <EOS> 163.52227951709335

<SOS> <SOS> my faults  according to this calculation  are heavy indeed <EOS> <EOS> 389.72048727123143
<SOS> <SOS> but perhaps   added he  stopping in his walk  and turning towards her   these offences might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design <EOS> <EOS> 408.32568649003485
<SOS> <SOS> these bitter accusations might have been suppressed  had i with greater policy concealed my struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by reflection  by every thing <EOS> <EOS> 335.7416698442663
<SOS> <SOS> nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related <EOS> <EOS> 311.384725620172
<SOS> <SOS> they were natural and just <EOS> <EOS> 195.24284632845684
<SOS> <SOS> could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections <EOS> <EOS> 128.64824411682005
<SOS> <SOS> to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own <EOS> <EOS> 355.4001285606562
<SOS> <SOS> she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she continued   you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it <EOS> <EOS> 135.0336622536645
<SOS> <SOS> again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification <EOS> <EOS> 154.57107620493636
<SOS> <SOS> from the very beginning  from the first moment i may almost say  of my acquaintance with you  your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation  on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry <EOS> <EOS> 200.8774848308135
<SOS> <SOS> you have said quite enough  madam <EOS> <EOS> 310.2933140349048
<SOS> <SOS> i perfectly comprehend your feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been <EOS> <EOS> 134.2824971385705
<SOS> <SOS> forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness <EOS> <EOS> 306.77939383870284
<SOS> <SOS> and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house <EOS> <EOS> 271.32700960192557
<SOS> <SOS> she knew not how to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour <EOS> <EOS> 358.5197490948337
<SOS> <SOS> her astonishment  as she reflected on what had passed  was increased by every review of it <EOS> <EOS> 208.47215265206654
<SOS> <SOS> that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 121.2033940406524
<SOS> <SOS> so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister  and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case  was almost incredible <EOS> <EOS> 217.60820426156573
<SOS> <SOS> it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection <EOS> <EOS> 314.45114151918546
<SOS> <SOS> but his pride  his abominable pride  his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane  his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could not justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited <EOS> <EOS> 190.72856484322034
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes <EOS> <EOS> 172.14490715662544
<SOS> <SOS> she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk  when the recollection of mr darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  she turned up the lane  which led her farther from the turnpike road <EOS> <EOS> 228.68651558033346
<SOS> <SOS> the park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground <EOS> <EOS> 246.25865866384112
<SOS> <SOS> after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she was tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the gates and look into the park <EOS> <EOS> 238.4070533129356
<SOS> <SOS> the five weeks which she had now passed in kent  had made a great difference in the country  and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees <EOS> <EOS> 126.9915276408826
<SOS> <SOS> but the person who advanced  was now near enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness  pronounced her name <EOS> <EOS> 292.2013637757489
<SOS> <SOS> he had by that time reached it also  and holding out a letter  which she instinctively took  said with a look of haughty composure   i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you <EOS> <EOS> 244.7980089555824
<SOS> <SOS> will you do me the honour of reading that letter <EOS> <EOS> 156.00180386193844
<SOS> <SOS> and then  with a slight bow  turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight <EOS> <EOS> 190.81368585865349
<SOS> <SOS> the envelope itself was likewise full <EOS> <EOS> 391.97514791240945
<SOS> <SOS> pursuing her way along the lane  she then began it <EOS> <EOS> 369.53887119728154
<SOS> <SOS> it was dated from rosings  at eight o clock in the morning  and was as follows          be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments       or renewal of those offers  which were last night so disgusting to      you <EOS> <EOS> 377.2021425720751
<SOS> <SOS> i write without any intention of paining you  or humbling      myself  by dwelling on wishes  which  for the happiness of both       cannot be too soon forgotten  and the effort which the formation       and the perusal of this letter must occasion  should have been      spared  had not my character required it to be written and read <EOS> <EOS> 242.78071024223806
<SOS> <SOS> two offences of a very different nature  and by no means of equal      magnitude  you last night laid to my charge <EOS> <EOS> 302.77502729225216
<SOS> <SOS> the first mentioned      was  that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i had detached      mr bingley from your sister   and the other  that i had  in      defiance of various claims  in defiance of honour and humanity       ruined the immediate prosperity  and blasted the prospects of mr      wickham <EOS> <EOS> 180.3618266941951
<SOS> <SOS> wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth  the acknowledged favourite of my father  a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage  and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion  would be a depravity       to which the separation of two young persons  whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks  could bear no comparison <EOS> <EOS> 266.11288400510233
<SOS> <SOS> but      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed  respecting each circumstance  i shall hope to be in      future secured  when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read <EOS> <EOS> 306.47682947540727
<SOS> <SOS> if  in the explanation of them which is      due to myself  i am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your s  i can only say that i am sorry <EOS> <EOS> 171.26997195817287
<SOS> <SOS> the      necessity must be obeyed  and farther apology would be absurd <EOS> <EOS> 283.5546916389318
<SOS> <SOS> i      had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common with      others  that bingley preferred your eldest sister  to any other      young woman in the country <EOS> <EOS> 177.06187034618813
<SOS> <SOS> but it was not till the evening of the      dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment <EOS> <EOS> 122.37278591937357
<SOS> <SOS> i had often seen him in love before <EOS> <EOS> 140.23133506948048
<SOS> <SOS> he spoke of it as a certain event       of which the time alone could be undecided <EOS> <EOS> 152.74269182399473
<SOS> <SOS> from that moment i      observed my friend s behaviour attentively  and i could then      perceive that his partiality for missennet was beyond what i had      ever witnessed in him <EOS> <EOS> 259.03592346459334
<SOS> <SOS> your sister i also watched <EOS> <EOS> 338.92069418682655
<SOS> <SOS> if  you  have not been mistaken here   i  must have      been in an error <EOS> <EOS> 102.71081965278243
<SOS> <SOS> if it be so  if i have been misled by such      error  to inflict pain on her  your resentment has not been      unreasonable <EOS> <EOS> 180.93559234005386
<SOS> <SOS> but i shall not scruple to assert  that the serenity      of your sister s countenance and air was such  as might have given      the most acute observer  a conviction that  however amiable her      temper  her heart was not likely to be easily touched <EOS> <EOS> 230.4136357459763
<SOS> <SOS> i did not believe her to be      indifferent because i wished it   i believed it on impartial      conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason <EOS> <EOS> 229.70457771821322
<SOS> <SOS> my objections to      the marriage were not merely those  which i last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside  in my      own case  the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me <EOS> <EOS> 271.8591955535709
<SOS> <SOS> but there were other causes of      repugnance   causes which  though still existing  and existing to      an equal degree in both instances  i had myself endeavoured to      forget  because they were not immediately before me <EOS> <EOS> 368.97039183927257
<SOS> <SOS> these causes      must be stated  though briefly <EOS> <EOS> 535.1611654664185
<SOS> <SOS> pardon me <EOS> <EOS> 282.96659155151724
<SOS> <SOS> it pains me to offend you <EOS> <EOS> 178.86637147643125
<SOS> <SOS> but amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations  and your      displeasure at this representation of them  let it give you      consolation to consider that  to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure  is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister  than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both <EOS> <EOS> 303.5856750643945
<SOS> <SOS> his      sisters  uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered  and  alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother  we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in london <EOS> <EOS> 329.2035120651324
<SOS> <SOS> but bingley has      great natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own <EOS> <EOS> 240.3867075303853
<SOS> <SOS> to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived      himself  was no very difficult point <EOS> <EOS> 273.54769408398823
<SOS> <SOS> i knew it myself  as      it was known to missingley  but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it <EOS> <EOS> 185.34862469968698
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps this      concealment  this disguise  was beneath me <EOS> <EOS> 551.9857000224134
<SOS> <SOS> on this subject i have nothing more      to say  no other apology to offer <EOS> <EOS> 184.86236560955936
<SOS> <SOS> mr wickham is the son of a very      respectable man  who had for many years the management of all the      pemberley estates  and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust  naturally inclined my father to be of service to him  and on      george wickham  who was his god son  his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed <EOS> <EOS> 241.78462383672462
<SOS> <SOS> my father supported him at school  and      afterwards at cambridge   most important assistance  as his own      father  always poor from the extravagance of his wife  would have      been unable to give him a gentleman s education <EOS> <EOS> 190.51920636017087
<SOS> <SOS> my father was not      only fond of this young man s society  whose manners were always      engaging  he had also the highest opinion of him  and hoping the      church would be his profession  intended to provide for him in it <EOS> <EOS> 212.06610992259084
<SOS> <SOS> the vicious propensities  the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend  could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself  and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments  which mr darcy could not have <EOS> <EOS> 122.73058236217958
<SOS> <SOS> here again i shall give you pain  to what degree you only can tell <EOS> <EOS> 344.506150998569
<SOS> <SOS> but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created  a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character <EOS> <EOS> 221.70116155982754
<SOS> <SOS> my excellent father      died about five years ago  and his attachment to mr wickham was to      the last so steady  that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me  to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow  and if he took orders  desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant <EOS> <EOS> 341.74062374756954
<SOS> <SOS> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds <EOS> <EOS> 147.92820624150514
<SOS> <SOS> his own      father did not long survive mine  and within half a year from these      events  mr wickham wrote to inform me that  having finally      resolved against taking orders  he hoped i should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage  in lieu of the preferment  by which he could not be      benefited <EOS> <EOS> 370.354114805849
<SOS> <SOS> he had some intention  he added  of studying the law       and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein <EOS> <EOS> 179.685631150797
<SOS> <SOS> i rather wished  than      believed him to be sincere  but at any rate  was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal <EOS> <EOS> 230.86874073298586
<SOS> <SOS> i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a      clergyman <EOS> <EOS> 99.15770909663837
<SOS> <SOS> he resigned all      claim to assistance in the church  were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it  and accepted in return three      thousand pounds <EOS> <EOS> 267.4076653469008
<SOS> <SOS> his circumstances  he      assured me  and i had no difficulty in believing it  were      exceedingly bad <EOS> <EOS> 215.03619445143286
<SOS> <SOS> he had found the law a most unprofitable study       and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained  if i would      present him to the living in question  of which he trusted there      could be little doubt  as he was well assured that i had no other      person to provide for  and i could not have forgotten my revered      father s intentions <EOS> <EOS> 150.11913837140872
<SOS> <SOS> you will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty  or for resisting every repetition of it <EOS> <EOS> 232.8275233108484
<SOS> <SOS> after this period  every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt <EOS> <EOS> 333.5346814450664
<SOS> <SOS> how he lived i know not <EOS> <EOS> 131.59995524533525
<SOS> <SOS> but      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice <EOS> <EOS> 458.66760484300875
<SOS> <SOS> i      must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget      myself  and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being <EOS> <EOS> 263.3600752209304
<SOS> <SOS> having said thus much  i feel no      doubt of your secrecy <EOS> <EOS> 281.537892087731
<SOS> <SOS> my sister  who is more than ten years my      junior  was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew  colonel      fitzwilliam  and myself <EOS> <EOS> 183.58809973529074
<SOS> <SOS> younge  in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  and by      her connivance and aid  he so far recommended himself to georgiana       whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child  that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love  and to consent to an elopement <EOS> <EOS> 255.4916869176057
<SOS> <SOS> i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement  and then georgiana  unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father  acknowledged the whole to me <EOS> <EOS> 298.11309156478296
<SOS> <SOS> you may imagine what i felt      and how i acted <EOS> <EOS> 177.41158082760424
<SOS> <SOS> younge was of course removed from      her charge <EOS> <EOS> 310.7791511830797
<SOS> <SOS> mr wickham s chief object was unquestionably my      sister s fortune  which is thirty thousand pounds  but i cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me  was a      strong inducement <EOS> <EOS> 215.85046715556257
<SOS> <SOS> you may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night <EOS> <EOS> 470.5705038748641
<SOS> <SOS> but i was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed <EOS> <EOS> 165.21141463157076
<SOS> <SOS> for the truth of every thing here related  i can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam  who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy  and still more as one of      the executors of my father s will  has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions <EOS> <EOS> 254.01092418566694
<SOS> <SOS> i will only add  god bless you <EOS> <EOS> 387.07543424848967
<SOS> <SOS> chapter xiii <EOS> <EOS> 373.1381887614955
<SOS> <SOS> if elizabeth  when mr darcy gave her the letter  did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no expectation at all of its contents <EOS> <EOS> 183.28410061770256
<SOS> <SOS> with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal <EOS> <EOS> 213.04087785407495
<SOS> <SOS> with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say  she began his account of what had happened at netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 268.91370033018217
<SOS> <SOS> she read  with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension  and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring  was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes <EOS> <EOS> 235.74601514178718
<SOS> <SOS> his belief of her sister s insensibility  she instantly resolved to be false  and his account of the real  the worst objections to the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice <EOS> <EOS> 184.8175776626595
<SOS> <SOS> it was all pride and insolence <EOS> <EOS> 77.97347437133787
<SOS> <SOS> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham  when she read with somewhat clearer attention  a relation of events  which  if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself  her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition <EOS> <EOS> 277.8149725236685
<SOS> <SOS> astonishment  apprehension  and even horror  oppressed her <EOS> <EOS> 544.2612043154171
<SOS> <SOS> she wished to discredit it entirely  repeatedly exclaiming   this must be false <EOS> <EOS> 534.1810954693574
<SOS> <SOS> this cannot be <EOS> <EOS> 139.56680196335077
<SOS> <SOS> this must be the grossest falsehood <EOS> <EOS> 118.26270612985678
<SOS> <SOS> and when she had gone through the whole letter  though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not regard it  that she would never look in it again <EOS> <EOS> 237.79084081103048
<SOS> <SOS> in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the letter was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she could  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham  and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence <EOS> <EOS> 222.90763098805797
<SOS> <SOS> the account of his connection with the pemberley family  was exactly what he had related himself  and the kindness of the late mr darcy  though she had not before known its extent  agreed equally well with his own words <EOS> <EOS> 169.63940257432992
<SOS> <SOS> so far each recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the will  the difference was great <EOS> <EOS> 262.86208488306227
<SOS> <SOS> but when she read  and re read with the closest attention  the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living  of his receiving in lieu  so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds  again was she forced to hesitate <EOS> <EOS> 381.9898176624998
<SOS> <SOS> she put down the letter  weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality  deliberated on the probability of each statement  but with little success <EOS> <EOS> 221.12557545033366
<SOS> <SOS> on both sides it was only assertion <EOS> <EOS> 273.54370604610415
<SOS> <SOS> again she read on <EOS> <EOS> 171.84824312325244
<SOS> <SOS> the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more so  as she could bring no proof of its injustice <EOS> <EOS> 210.51787805448575
<SOS> <SOS> she had never heard of him before his entrance into the     shire militia  in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man  who  on meeting him accidentally in town  had there renewed a slight acquaintance <EOS> <EOS> 224.2280541695841
<SOS> <SOS> of his former way of life  nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself <EOS> <EOS> 166.11023650691118
<SOS> <SOS> his countenance  voice  and manner  had established him at once in the possession of every virtue <EOS> <EOS> 232.07876430576843
<SOS> <SOS> she tried to recollect some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for those casual errors  under which she would endeavour to class  what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance <EOS> <EOS> 230.73596340562875
<SOS> <SOS> but no such recollection befriended her <EOS> <EOS> 162.99085433252344
<SOS> <SOS> she could see him instantly before her  in every charm of air and address  but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood  and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess <EOS> <EOS> 160.52322764013286
<SOS> <SOS> but  alas <EOS> <EOS> 245.24563192972002
<SOS> <SOS> at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him  but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application  and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration <EOS> <EOS> 123.36157015576717
<SOS> <SOS> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory <EOS> <EOS> 250.79949002194815
<SOS> <SOS> she was  now  struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger  and wondered it had escaped her before <EOS> <EOS> 158.9404377023829
<SOS> <SOS> she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done  and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct <EOS> <EOS> 139.74586564583893
<SOS> <SOS> she remembered also  that till the netherfield family had quitted the country  he had told his story to no one but herself  but that after their removal  it had been every where discussed  that he had then no reserves  no scruples in sinking mr darcy s character  though he had assured her that respect for the father  would always prevent his exposing the son <EOS> <EOS> 249.48075462678398
<SOS> <SOS> how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned <EOS> <EOS> 284.93462473351707
<SOS> <SOS> his attentions to missing were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes  but his eagerness to grasp at any thing <EOS> <EOS> 186.2451999797411
<SOS> <SOS> his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive  he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn <EOS> <EOS> 323.4709556465098
<SOS> <SOS> that had his actions been what wickham represented them  so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world  and that friendship between a person capable of it  and such an amiable man as mr bingley  was incomprehensible <EOS> <EOS> 254.7578338299545
<SOS> <SOS> she grew absolutely ashamed of herself <EOS> <EOS> 372.74397341806963
<SOS> <SOS> of neither darcy nor wickham could she think  without feeling that she had been blind  partial  prejudiced  absurd <EOS> <EOS> 352.6898639902395

<SOS> <SOS> widely different was the effect of a second perusal <EOS> <EOS> 263.5708505794424
<SOS> <SOS> how could she deny that credit to his assertions  in one instance  which she had been obliged to give in the other <EOS> <EOS> 131.4277729205404
<SOS> <SOS> he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment   and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been <EOS> <EOS> 141.1465397382907
<SOS> <SOS> she felt that jane s feelings  though fervent  were little displayed  and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner  not often united with great sensibility <EOS> <EOS> 199.30431685541467
<SOS> <SOS> when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned  in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her sense of shame was severe <EOS> <EOS> 242.54280472519426
<SOS> <SOS> the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial  and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded  as having passed at the netherfield ball  and as confirming all his first disapprobation  could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers <EOS> <EOS> 305.291291395052
<SOS> <SOS> it soothed  but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family   and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations  and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct  she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before <EOS> <EOS> 201.21178142030885
<SOS> <SOS> after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every variety of thought  re considering events  determining probabilities  and reconciling herself as well as she could  to a change so sudden and so important  fatigue  and a recollection of her long absence  made her at length return home  and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual  and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation <EOS> <EOS> 326.7074037515819
<SOS> <SOS> she was immediately told  that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence  mr darcy  only for a few minutes to take leave  but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour  hoping for her return  and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found <EOS> <EOS> 281.6768817523552
<SOS> <SOS> colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object <EOS> <EOS> 395.0692825508301

<SOS> <SOS> the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting obeisance  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of their appearing in very good health  and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected  after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings <EOS> <EOS> 331.2196425624185
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting  that had she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to her  as her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of what her ladyship s indignation would have been <EOS> <EOS> 230.67224943519494

<SOS> <SOS> how would she have behaved <EOS> <EOS> 279.26088356826637
<SOS> <SOS> were questions with which she amused herself <EOS> <EOS> 221.0657745889805
<SOS> <SOS> their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party <EOS> <EOS> 103.82282484659584
<SOS> <SOS> i assure you  i feel it exceedingly   said lady catherine   i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do <EOS> <EOS> 255.81970175328414
<SOS> <SOS> they were excessively sorry to go <EOS> <EOS> 209.95712600004777
<SOS> <SOS> the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last  but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely  more i think than last year <EOS> <EOS> 668.380846314281
<SOS> <SOS> his attachment to rosings  certainly increases <EOS> <EOS> 276.5039398868847
<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine observed  after dinner  that missennet seemed out of spirits  and immediately accounting for it herself  by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon  she added   but if that is the case  you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer <EOS> <EOS> 241.49194630059534

<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey  and as she did not answer them all herself  attention was necessary  which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or  with a mind so occupied  she might have forgotten where she was <EOS> <EOS> 246.75618545262273
<SOS> <SOS> reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was alone  she gave way to it as the greatest relief  and not a day went by without a solitary walk  in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections <EOS> <EOS> 326.8768409011009
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy s letter  she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart <EOS> <EOS> 120.06173782692959

<SOS> <SOS> his attachment excited gratitude  his general character respect  but she could not approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again <EOS> <EOS> 383.7018670415446
<SOS> <SOS> in her own past behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and regret  and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin <EOS> <EOS> 148.4250929896368
<SOS> <SOS> they were hopeless of remedy <EOS> <EOS> 223.31733505910125

<SOS> <SOS> anxiety on jane s behalf  was another prevailing concern  and mr darcy s explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion  heightened the sense of what jane had lost <EOS> <EOS> 202.48587111900048
<SOS> <SOS> how grievous then was the thought that  of a situation so desirable in every respect  so replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had been deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family <EOS> <EOS> 199.85901802914165
<SOS> <SOS> when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character  it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before  were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful <EOS> <EOS> 328.5353427263789

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case  and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts <EOS> <EOS> 262.05864773884764
<SOS> <SOS> she was not sorry  however  to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung <EOS> <EOS> 101.03870807724624

<SOS> <SOS> but jane was to go home with her  and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation <EOS> <EOS> 150.4452446797697
<SOS> <SOS> to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane  and must  at the same time  so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away  was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered  but the state of indecision in which she remained  as to the extent of what she should communicate  and her fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried into repeating something of bingley  which might only grieve her sister farther <EOS> <EOS> 187.30425990993956

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth listened as little as she could  but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name <EOS> <EOS> 139.68275630694671

<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> mary   said she   i wish you had gone with us  for we had such fun <EOS> <EOS> 225.55418471770386
<SOS> <SOS> as we went along  kitty and me drew up all the blinds  and pretended there was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone so all the way  if kitty had not been sick  and when we got to the george  i do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and if you would have gone  we would have treated you too <EOS> <EOS> 190.08863012265505
<SOS> <SOS> and then when we came away it was such fun <EOS> <EOS> 224.45060006043028
<SOS> <SOS> i thought we never should have got into the coach <EOS> <EOS> 219.0487372704056
<SOS> <SOS> and then we were so merry all the way home <EOS> <EOS> 194.99734678513025
<SOS> <SOS> we talked and laughed so loud  that any body might have heard us ten miles off <EOS> <EOS> 560.5904161528711

<SOS> <SOS> i should infinitely prefer a book <EOS> <EOS> 398.5713292301533
<SOS> <SOS> but of this answer lydia heard not a word <EOS> <EOS> 211.28091662337644
<SOS> <SOS> it should not be said  that the missennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers <EOS> <EOS> 100.82669351948581
<SOS> <SOS> there was another reason too for her opposition <EOS> <EOS> 276.92618612765654
<SOS> <SOS> she dreaded seeing wickham again  and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible <EOS> <EOS> 267.14177819479204
<SOS> <SOS> the comfort to  her   of the regiment s approaching removal  was indeed beyond expression <EOS> <EOS> 323.8226205632261
<SOS> <SOS> in a fortnight they were to go  and once gone  she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account <EOS> <EOS> 189.07260029657294
<SOS> <SOS> she had not been many hours at home  before she found that the brighton scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn  was under frequent discussion between her parents <EOS> <EOS> 243.5281355402561
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding  but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal  that her mother  though often disheartened  had never yet despaired of succeeding at last <EOS> <EOS> 174.54679298111225
<SOS> <SOS> chapter xvii <EOS> <EOS> 348.6544485054442
<SOS> <SOS> missennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings <EOS> <EOS> 404.51397024311206
<SOS> <SOS> she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him <EOS> <EOS> 159.86454181907087
<SOS> <SOS> his being so sure of succeeding  was wrong   said she   and certainly ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it must increase his disappointment <EOS> <EOS> 323.4988949780872
<SOS> <SOS> indeed   replied elizabeth   i am heartily sorry for him  but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me <EOS> <EOS> 257.3641143233765
<SOS> <SOS> you do not blame me  however  for refusing him <EOS> <EOS> 167.50128743959743
<SOS> <SOS> no  i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did <EOS> <EOS> 88.08354185430427
<SOS> <SOS> but you  will  know it  when i have told you what happened the very next day <EOS> <EOS> 129.83455595855557
<SOS> <SOS> she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham <EOS> <EOS> 341.21796250773224
<SOS> <SOS> what a stroke was this for poor jane <EOS> <EOS> 310.6259408941204
<SOS> <SOS> most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error  and seek to clear one  without involving the other <EOS> <EOS> 293.23902485428135
<SOS> <SOS> this will not do   said elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 152.68969014860767
<SOS> <SOS> you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing <EOS> <EOS> 137.30404941246292
<SOS> <SOS> take your choice  but you must be satisfied with only one <EOS> <EOS> 189.63560317157132
<SOS> <SOS> for my part  i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s  but you shall do as you chuse <EOS> <EOS> 109.44485570153086
<SOS> <SOS> it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from jane <EOS> <EOS> 111.15698032995381
<SOS> <SOS> it is almost past belief <EOS> <EOS> 369.3771221762054
<SOS> <SOS> and poor mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 87.60658022320777
<SOS> <SOS> dear lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered <EOS> <EOS> 291.14808271767555
<SOS> <SOS> such a disappointment <EOS> <EOS> 146.8662267846951
<SOS> <SOS> and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too <EOS> <EOS> 113.31767060311324
<SOS> <SOS> and having to relate such a thing of his sister <EOS> <EOS> 91.27124893071361
<SOS> <SOS> it is really too distressing <EOS> <EOS> 227.94828708904734
<SOS> <SOS> i am sure you must feel it so <EOS> <EOS> 77.81754952204531
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both <EOS> <EOS> 403.5588420330463
<SOS> <SOS> your profusion makes me saving  and if you lament over him much longer  my heart will be as light as a feather <EOS> <EOS> 237.583310123006
<SOS> <SOS> such an openness and gentleness in his manner <EOS> <EOS> 205.1928422930226
<SOS> <SOS> one has got all the goodness  and the other all the appearance of it <EOS> <EOS> 140.40164501236984
<SOS> <SOS> i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it as you used to do <EOS> <EOS> 91.78688504194082
<SOS> <SOS> and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him  without any reason <EOS> <EOS> 296.0571252523434
<SOS> <SOS> one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just  but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty <EOS> <EOS> 312.5560607736052
<SOS> <SOS> lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now <EOS> <EOS> 137.4705961542595
<SOS> <SOS> indeed i could not <EOS> <EOS> 87.50762702855921
<SOS> <SOS> i was uncomfortable enough <EOS> <EOS> 213.86163399579831
<SOS> <SOS> i was very uncomfortable  i may say unhappy <EOS> <EOS> 241.01713001983657

<SOS> <SOS> how i wanted you <EOS> <EOS> 149.29016076470393
<SOS> <SOS> how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy  for now they  do  appear wholly undeserved <EOS> <EOS> 228.00815250857872
<SOS> <SOS> certainly <EOS> <EOS> 219.73751902542006
<SOS> <SOS> but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness  is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging <EOS> <EOS> 202.5723840259553
<SOS> <SOS> there is one point  on which i want your advice <EOS> <EOS> 234.56648848922856
<SOS> <SOS> i want to be told whether i ought  or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character <EOS> <EOS> 294.056954076254
<SOS> <SOS> missennet paused a little and then replied   surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully <EOS> <EOS> 405.5475862646817
<SOS> <SOS> what is your own opinion <EOS> <EOS> 129.79796700904137
<SOS> <SOS> that it ought not to be attempted <EOS> <EOS> 119.43680838358843
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public <EOS> <EOS> 107.50598378199963
<SOS> <SOS> on the contrary every particular relative to his sister  was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct  who will believe me <EOS> <EOS> 140.38814739092788
<SOS> <SOS> the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent  that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton  to attempt to place him in an amiable light <EOS> <EOS> 161.49299118586399
<SOS> <SOS> i am not equal to it <EOS> <EOS> 84.33190880409406
<SOS> <SOS> wickham will soon be gone  and therefore it will not signify to anybody here  what he really is <EOS> <EOS> 263.2468454977356
<SOS> <SOS> sometime hence it will be all found out  and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before <EOS> <EOS> 225.01624397077197
<SOS> <SOS> you are quite right <EOS> <EOS> 240.9665990371638
<SOS> <SOS> he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done  and anxious to re establish a character <EOS> <EOS> 252.72753536951004
<SOS> <SOS> we must not make him desperate <EOS> <EOS> 176.01079277487094
<SOS> <SOS> the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation <EOS> <EOS> 96.5824296118472
<SOS> <SOS> she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight  and was certain of a willing listener in jane  whenever she might wish to talk again of either <EOS> <EOS> 199.41104975177882

<SOS> <SOS> the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value <EOS> <EOS> 341.65759949684326
<SOS> <SOS> she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits <EOS> <EOS> 159.27925647923036
<SOS> <SOS> having never even fancied herself in love before  her regard had all the warmth of first attachment  and from her age and disposition  greater steadiness than first attachments often boast  and so fervently did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every other man  that all her good sense  and all her attention to the feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets  which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity <EOS> <EOS> 185.1362433617602
<SOS> <SOS> bennet one day   what is your opinion  now  of this sad business of jane s <EOS> <EOS> 248.63756040437966
<SOS> <SOS> for my part  i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody <EOS> <EOS> 172.77993610368333
<SOS> <SOS> i told my sister philips so the other day <EOS> <EOS> 150.6557850895132

<SOS> <SOS> she had even learnt to detect  in the very gentleness which had first delighted her  an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary <EOS> <EOS> 157.1078675506656
<SOS> <SOS> in his present behaviour to herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance  could only serve  after what had since passed  to provoke her <EOS> <EOS> 346.5930546615862
<SOS> <SOS> she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry  and while she steadily repressed it  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing  that however long  and for whatever cause  his attentions had been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal <EOS> <EOS> 342.6252161819655
<SOS> <SOS> on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton  he dined with others of the officers at longbourn  and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour  that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford  she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings  and asked him if he were acquainted with the former <EOS> <EOS> 218.9115112639545

<SOS> <SOS> in essentials  i believe  he is very much what he ever was <EOS> <EOS> 172.83179705199876
<SOS> <SOS> there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention  while she added   when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement  but that from knowing him better  his disposition was better understood <EOS> <EOS> 257.51433431283533
<SOS> <SOS> wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off his embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the gentlest of accents   you  who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy  will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the  appearance  of what is right <EOS> <EOS> 319.68178213866025
<SOS> <SOS> his pride  in that direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by <EOS> <EOS> 166.22892234241766

<SOS> <SOS> his fear of her  has always operated  i know  when they were together  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with misse bourgh  which i am certain he has very much at heart <EOS> <EOS> 163.72772118286252
<SOS> <SOS> she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances  and she was in no humour to indulge him <EOS> <EOS> 131.0316558051321
<SOS> <SOS> the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance   on his side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth  and they parted at last with mutual civility  and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again <EOS> <EOS> 308.53579004410625
<SOS> <SOS> the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic <EOS> <EOS> 224.44551302015523
<SOS> <SOS> bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter  and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible  advice  which there was every reason to believe would be attended to  and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard <EOS> <EOS> 150.99938222781654

<SOS> <SOS> respect  esteem  and confidence  had vanished for ever  and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown <EOS> <EOS> 464.55456283570487

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband <EOS> <EOS> 105.657510455156
<SOS> <SOS> she had always seen it with pain  but respecting his abilities  and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself  she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook  and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which  in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children  was so highly reprehensible <EOS> <EOS> 269.76264068230705
<SOS> <SOS> but she had never felt so strongly as now  the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents  talents which rightly used  might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife <EOS> <EOS> 349.4100378932343

<SOS> <SOS> she approached  and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended  amongst several other miniatures  over the mantle piece <EOS> <EOS> 427.14484131157946
<SOS> <SOS> her aunt asked her  smilingly  how she liked it <EOS> <EOS> 258.4749932907718
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth could not return it <EOS> <EOS> 170.94938664760343
<SOS> <SOS> reynolds  pointing to another of the miniatures   is my master  and very like him <EOS> <EOS> 322.710286633371
<SOS> <SOS> it was drawn at the same time as the other  about eight years ago <EOS> <EOS> 237.5829834503697
<SOS> <SOS> i have heard much of your master s fine person   said mr <EOS> <EOS> 191.515237872293
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner  looking at the picture   it is a handsome face <EOS> <EOS> 208.37099019090593
<SOS> <SOS> but  lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not <EOS> <EOS> 248.94220977067098
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> does that young lady know mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 174.05454015167874
<SOS> <SOS> and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am <EOS> <EOS> 208.4393781669037
<SOS> <SOS> yes  very handsome <EOS> <EOS> 263.42936590456975
<SOS> <SOS> this room was my late master s favourite room  and these miniatures are just as they used to be then <EOS> <EOS> 376.71542953490047
<SOS> <SOS> this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham s being among them <EOS> <EOS> 145.86185739687994
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> and is missarcy as handsome as her brother <EOS> <EOS> 185.72190047152836
<SOS> <SOS> said mr gardiner <EOS> <EOS> 100.8174539687598
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> she plays and sings all day long <EOS> <EOS> 162.3646313860216
<SOS> <SOS> in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her  a present from my master  she comes here to morrow with him <EOS> <EOS> 281.181929460883
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner  whose manners were easy and pleasant  encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks  mr <EOS> <EOS> 312.46593647816525
<SOS> <SOS> reynolds  either from pride or attachment  had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister <EOS> <EOS> 300.85589632729767
<SOS> <SOS> is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year <EOS> <EOS> 138.38182847692312
<SOS> <SOS> not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend half his time here  and missarcy is always down for the summer months <EOS> <EOS> 296.33396806628747
<SOS> <SOS> except   thought elizabeth   when she goes to ramsgate <EOS> <EOS> 312.1209952053999
<SOS> <SOS> i do not know who is good enough for him <EOS> <EOS> 92.72033358163452
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could not help saying   it is very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think so <EOS> <EOS> 76.83925396419697
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth thought this was going pretty far  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added   i have never had a cross word from him in my life  and i have known him ever since he was four years old <EOS> <EOS> 279.10531384289357
<SOS> <SOS> this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite to her ideas <EOS> <EOS> 312.55488685139784
<SOS> <SOS> her keenest attention was awakened  she longed to hear more  and was grateful to her uncle for saying   there are very few people of whom so much can be said <EOS> <EOS> 269.9377377323591
<SOS> <SOS> you are lucky in having such a master <EOS> <EOS> 164.66373087069456
<SOS> <SOS> yes  sir  i know i am <EOS> <EOS> 117.45650571504213
<SOS> <SOS> but i have always observed  that they who are good natured when children  are good natured when they grow up  and he was always the sweetest tempered  most generous hearted  boy in the world <EOS> <EOS> 353.26378481003195
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth almost stared at her <EOS> <EOS> 179.69462948134304
<SOS> <SOS> can this be mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 115.3622327902833
<SOS> <SOS> thought she <EOS> <EOS> 151.10494797416524
<SOS> <SOS> his father was an excellent man   said mr <EOS> <EOS> 188.07676838453872
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner <EOS> <EOS> 198.2305811490288
<SOS> <SOS> yes  ma am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like him  just as affable to the poor <EOS> <EOS> 202.4618158003321
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> reynolds could interest her on no other point <EOS> <EOS> 361.4609321895759
<SOS> <SOS> she related the subject of the pictures  the dimensions of the rooms  and the price of the furniture  in vain <EOS> <EOS> 70.29046101023567
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner  highly amused by the kind of family prejudice  to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master  soon led again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his many merits  as they proceeded together up the great staircase <EOS> <EOS> 281.2433578342105
<SOS> <SOS> he is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that ever lived <EOS> <EOS> 236.06229332285574
<SOS> <SOS> not like the wild young men now a days  who think of nothing but themselves <EOS> <EOS> 358.17527653879176
<SOS> <SOS> some people call him proud  but i am sure i never saw any thing of it <EOS> <EOS> 160.477078414649
<SOS> <SOS> to my fancy  it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men <EOS> <EOS> 316.1391773841536
<SOS> <SOS> in what an amiable light does this place him <EOS> <EOS> 409.10078900667133
<SOS> <SOS> thought elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 164.0149570305191
<SOS> <SOS> this fine account of him   whispered her aunt  as they walked   is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend <EOS> <EOS> 297.1824726637352
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps we might be deceived <EOS> <EOS> 279.3605841898631
<SOS> <SOS> that is not very likely  our authority was too good <EOS> <EOS> 258.4777996246565
<SOS> <SOS> he is certainly a good brother   said elizabeth  as she walked towards one of the windows <EOS> <EOS> 164.0227402570495
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> and this is always the way with him   she added <EOS> <EOS> 160.5097626806082
<SOS> <SOS> whatever can give his sister any pleasure  is sure to be done in a moment <EOS> <EOS> 175.2509806345767
<SOS> <SOS> there is nothing he would not do for her <EOS> <EOS> 65.00659748686472
<SOS> <SOS> the picture gallery  and two or three of the principal bed rooms  were all that remained to be shewn <EOS> <EOS> 371.87008209746165
<SOS> <SOS> in the former were many good paintings  but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such as had been already visible below  she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of missarcy s  in crayons  whose subjects were usually more interesting  and also more intelligible <EOS> <EOS> 274.8842189344159
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her <EOS> <EOS> 187.67661511036695
<SOS> <SOS> at last it arrested her  and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy  with such a smile over the face  as she remembered to have sometimes seen  when he looked at her <EOS> <EOS> 194.1114925274893
<SOS> <SOS> she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation  and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery <EOS> <EOS> 402.23509664982925
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> reynolds informed them  that it had been taken in his father s life time <EOS> <EOS> 133.34353030005448
<SOS> <SOS> there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth s mind  a more gentle sensation towards the original  than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance <EOS> <EOS> 218.9990754855185
<SOS> <SOS> the commendation bestowed on him by mr <EOS> <EOS> 355.0689682138184
<SOS> <SOS> reynolds was of no trifling nature <EOS> <EOS> 334.3210774593453
<SOS> <SOS> what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant <EOS> <EOS> 280.4793358058631
<SOS> <SOS> as a brother  a landlord  a master  she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship <EOS> <EOS> 389.43770109066463
<SOS> <SOS> how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow <EOS> <EOS> 183.74568030022866
<SOS> <SOS> every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she stood before the canvas  on which he was represented  and fixed his eyes upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its warmth  and softened its impropriety of expression <EOS> <EOS> 231.91979250734377
<SOS> <SOS> when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen  they returned down stairs  and taking leave of the housekeeper  were consigned over to the gardener  who met them at the hall door <EOS> <EOS> 276.3748631664031
<SOS> <SOS> they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was his appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight <EOS> <EOS> 177.83068437993947
<SOS> <SOS> their eyes instantly met  and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush <EOS> <EOS> 316.0290878424656
<SOS> <SOS> she had instinctively turned away  but  stopping on his approach  received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome <EOS> <EOS> 390.7609018912085
<SOS> <SOS> nor did he seem much more at ease  when he spoke  his accent had none of its usual sedateness  and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn  and of her stay in derbyshire  so often  and in so hurried a way  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts <EOS> <EOS> 200.12186621646597
<SOS> <SOS> at length  every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a few moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected himself  and took leave <EOS> <EOS> 500.31552086388604
<SOS> <SOS> the others then joined her  and expressed their admiration of his figure  but elizabeth heard not a word  and  wholly engrossed by her own feelings  followed them in silence <EOS> <EOS> 245.46740411270832
<SOS> <SOS> her coming there was the most unfortunate  the most ill judged thing in the world <EOS> <EOS> 231.68501501599422
<SOS> <SOS> how strange must it appear to him <EOS> <EOS> 301.60781105428606
<SOS> <SOS> in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man <EOS> <EOS> 366.70345523293486
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> why did she come <EOS> <EOS> 253.75075741053405
<SOS> <SOS> had they been only ten minutes sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination  for it was plain that he was that moment arrived  that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage <EOS> <EOS> 179.98446621622423
<SOS> <SOS> she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting <EOS> <EOS> 148.5336991714718
<SOS> <SOS> and his behaviour  so strikingly altered   what could it mean <EOS> <EOS> 229.51766458520248
<SOS> <SOS> that he should even speak to her was amazing <EOS> <EOS> 204.33035976454326
<SOS> <SOS> but to speak with such civility  to enquire after her family <EOS> <EOS> 190.38975226518647
<SOS> <SOS> never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified  never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting <EOS> <EOS> 386.76557963194574
<SOS> <SOS> what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park  when he put his letter into her hand <EOS> <EOS> 291.2512037755654
<SOS> <SOS> she knew not what to think  nor how to account for it <EOS> <EOS> 135.78832756888085
<SOS> <SOS> she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind  in what manner he thought of her  and whether  in defiance of every thing  she was still dear to him <EOS> <EOS> 140.086665980113
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps he had been civil  only because he felt himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice  which was not like ease <EOS> <EOS> 216.30235070774592
<SOS> <SOS> whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her  she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her with composure <EOS> <EOS> 201.28081734256213
<SOS> <SOS> at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself <EOS> <EOS> 207.4709137195022
<SOS> <SOS> they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a while  ascended some of the higher grounds  whence  in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many charming views of the valley  the opposite hills  with the long range of woods overspreading many  and occasionally part of the stream <EOS> <EOS> 357.05265679955176
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park  but feared it might be beyond a walk <EOS> <EOS> 272.01866982210845
<SOS> <SOS> it settled the matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which brought them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  to the edge of the water  in one of its narrowest parts <EOS> <EOS> 215.13363130930622
<SOS> <SOS> they crossed it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air of the scene  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited  and the valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed room only for the stream  and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it <EOS> <EOS> 288.7507433427658
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth longed to explore its windings  but when they had crossed the bridge  and perceived their distance from the house  mr <EOS> <EOS> 200.31609388096976
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner  who was not a great walker  could go no farther  and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible <EOS> <EOS> 273.27646929303455
<SOS> <SOS> her niece was  therefore  obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but their progress was slow  for mr gardiner  though seldom able to indulge the taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water  and talking to the man about them  that he advanced but little <EOS> <EOS> 243.04305409343849
<SOS> <SOS> whilst wandering on in this slow manner  they were again surprised  and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first  by the sight of mr darcy approaching them  and at no great distance <EOS> <EOS> 230.9595490012404
<SOS> <SOS> the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before they met <EOS> <EOS> 344.8843781964869
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more prepared for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness  if he really intended to meet them <EOS> <EOS> 304.1043942930489
<SOS> <SOS> for a few moments  indeed  she felt that he would probably strike into some other path <EOS> <EOS> 271.70815206896066
<SOS> <SOS> this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view  the turning past  he was immediately before them <EOS> <EOS> 453.24467786864403
<SOS> <SOS> with a glance she saw  that he had lost none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his politeness  she began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  but she had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her  might be mischievously construed <EOS> <EOS> 218.4761667120813
<SOS> <SOS> her colour changed  and she said no more <EOS> <EOS> 189.4105213360893
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing  he asked her  if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends <EOS> <EOS> 161.64602458033556
<SOS> <SOS> this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared  and she could hardly suppress a smile  at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people  against whom his pride had revolted  in his offer to herself <EOS> <EOS> 183.8169858348654
<SOS> <SOS> the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named their relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to see how he bore it  and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions <EOS> <EOS> 188.250700084748
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could not but be pleased  could not but triumph <EOS> <EOS> 252.1122977664241
<SOS> <SOS> it was consoling  that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush <EOS> <EOS> 141.91085972409672
<SOS> <SOS> the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr darcy invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as often as he chose  while he continued in the neighbourhood  offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle  and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport <EOS> <EOS> 312.51797198886095
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner  who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of her wonder <EOS> <EOS> 313.1766034755052
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth said nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment must be all for herself <EOS> <EOS> 204.1849140545303
<SOS> <SOS> from what can it proceed <EOS> <EOS> 240.17204199235
<SOS> <SOS> it cannot be for  me   it cannot be for  my  sake that his manners are thus softened <EOS> <EOS> 176.6558364478212
<SOS> <SOS> my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this <EOS> <EOS> 243.94815120934376
<SOS> <SOS> it is impossible that he should still love me <EOS> <EOS> 130.3111436874838
<SOS> <SOS> after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the two gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant  there chanced to be a little alteration <EOS> <EOS> 261.72494089347765
<SOS> <SOS> it originated in mr <EOS> <EOS> 296.37357530765433
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the morning  found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support  and consequently preferred her husband s <EOS> <EOS> 214.1980346525797
<SOS> <SOS> she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place  and accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been very unexpected   for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow  and indeed  before we left bakewell  we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country <EOS> <EOS> 165.6669231655138
<SOS> <SOS> they will join me early to morrow   he continued   and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you   mr bingley and his sisters <EOS> <EOS> 280.8017578099702
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth answered only by a slight bow <EOS> <EOS> 245.3853875787628
<SOS> <SOS> her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley s name had been last mentioned between them  and if she might judge from his complexion   his  mind was not very differently engaged <EOS> <EOS> 217.79146713135094
<SOS> <SOS> there is also one other person in the party   he continued after a pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you   will you allow me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton <EOS> <EOS> 274.9085965315747
<SOS> <SOS> they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought <EOS> <EOS> 346.1067176296629
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was flattered and pleased <EOS> <EOS> 154.2238659808938
<SOS> <SOS> his wish of introducing his sister to her  was a compliment of the highest kind <EOS> <EOS> 127.55338214890271
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind <EOS> <EOS> 245.9643988551298
<SOS> <SOS> he then asked her to walk into the house  but she declared herself not tired  and they stood together on the lawn <EOS> <EOS> 236.44637814085664
<SOS> <SOS> at such a time  much might have been said  and silence was very awkward <EOS> <EOS> 171.1387217447262
<SOS> <SOS> she wanted to talk  but there seemed an embargo on every subject <EOS> <EOS> 204.677190645482
<SOS> <SOS> at last she recollected that she had been travelling  and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance <EOS> <EOS> 250.31625168462605
<SOS> <SOS> on mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 189.59441138541266
<SOS> <SOS> the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected <EOS> <EOS> 179.3225562260398
<SOS> <SOS> he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and unassuming   said her uncle <EOS> <EOS> 373.74454317163173
<SOS> <SOS> there  is  something a little stately in him to be sure   replied her aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not unbecoming <EOS> <EOS> 127.89812933973084
<SOS> <SOS> i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us <EOS> <EOS> 167.0185425230092
<SOS> <SOS> to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as wickham  or rather he has not wickham s countenance  for his features are perfectly good <EOS> <EOS> 220.23943473440494
<SOS> <SOS> but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable <EOS> <EOS> 146.92403928541913
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before  and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning <EOS> <EOS> 159.87578529186092

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character  but said nothing <EOS> <EOS> 200.03284759668017
<SOS> <SOS> from what we have seen of him   continued mr <EOS> <EOS> 194.97401711158398
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner   i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body  as he has done by poor wickham <EOS> <EOS> 205.17000458608524
<SOS> <SOS> he has not an ill natured look <EOS> <EOS> 215.49229427462592
<SOS> <SOS> on the contrary  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks <EOS> <EOS> 218.39738828863
<SOS> <SOS> and there is something of dignity in his countenance  that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart <EOS> <EOS> 176.25004371176325
<SOS> <SOS> i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes <EOS> <EOS> 768.1526688382759

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them to understand  in as guarded a manner as she could  that by what she had heard from his relations in kent  his actions were capable of a very different construction  and that his character was by no means so faulty  nor wickham s so amiable  as they had been considered in hertfordshire <EOS> <EOS> 211.7960576251239
<SOS> <SOS> in confirmation of this  she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected  without actually naming her authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on <EOS> <EOS> 175.3137610309677
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave way to the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs  to think of any thing else <EOS> <EOS> 213.24929817848707
<SOS> <SOS> fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk  they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance  and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance <EOS> <EOS> 205.39476521763368
<SOS> <SOS> chapter ii <EOS> <EOS> 343.8286020008905
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her  the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning <EOS> <EOS> 166.51569957282558
<SOS> <SOS> they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends  and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window  and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle  driving up the street <EOS> <EOS> 250.28596452226114
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth immediately recognising the livery  guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations  by acquainting them with the honour which she expected <EOS> <EOS> 203.1748637654942
<SOS> <SOS> her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke  joined to the circumstance itself  and many of the circumstances of the preceding day  opened to them a new idea on the business <EOS> <EOS> 197.19274805604508
<SOS> <SOS> nothing had ever suggested it before  but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter  than by supposing a partiality for their niece <EOS> <EOS> 240.18411776126888
<SOS> <SOS> while these newly born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing <EOS> <EOS> 276.56550599439305
<SOS> <SOS> she was quite amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of disquiet  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour  and more than commonly anxious to please  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her <EOS> <EOS> 273.7008982890524
<SOS> <SOS> missarcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable introduction took place <EOS> <EOS> 536.6632713512861
<SOS> <SOS> since her being at lambton  she had heard that missarcy was exceedingly proud  but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her  that she was only exceedingly shy <EOS> <EOS> 236.9916147201549
<SOS> <SOS> she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable <EOS> <EOS> 176.09300313469893
<SOS> <SOS> missarcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and  though little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her appearance womanly and graceful <EOS> <EOS> 225.45270844915956
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been  was much relieved by discerning such different feelings <EOS> <EOS> 200.31976581167348
<SOS> <SOS> they had not been long together  before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time to express her satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he entered the room <EOS> <EOS> 171.50204794630713
<SOS> <SOS> all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away  but  had she still felt any  it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself  on seeing her again <EOS> <EOS> 377.35688153196077
<SOS> <SOS> he enquired in a friendly  though general way  after her family  and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done <EOS> <EOS> 241.6187132393149
<SOS> <SOS> to mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 167.40650489407338
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself <EOS> <EOS> 193.7542484051338
<SOS> <SOS> they had long wished to see him <EOS> <EOS> 128.9764369760854
<SOS> <SOS> the whole party before them  indeed  excited a lively attention <EOS> <EOS> 406.1684899355811
<SOS> <SOS> the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece  directed their observation towards each with an earnest  though guarded  enquiry  and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love <EOS> <EOS> 400.3700427944422
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  on her side  had much to do <EOS> <EOS> 108.27765419333097
<SOS> <SOS> bingley was ready  georgiana was eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased <EOS> <EOS> 307.29373895429063
<SOS> <SOS> in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  and oh <EOS> <EOS> 272.25493685331975
<SOS> <SOS> sometimes she could fancy  that he talked less than on former occasions  and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her  he was trying to trace a resemblance <EOS> <EOS> 337.7822237124785
<SOS> <SOS> nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister <EOS> <EOS> 192.56024476627456
<SOS> <SOS> on this point she was soon satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a recollection of jane  not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared <EOS> <EOS> 308.95283792488607
<SOS> <SOS> we have not met since the 26th of november  when we were all dancing together at netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 205.23915839624865
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he afterwards took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of the rest  whether  all  her sisters were at longbourn <EOS> <EOS> 242.40382323285286
<SOS> <SOS> there was not much in the question  nor in the preceding remark  but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning <EOS> <EOS> 180.5313960438154
<SOS> <SOS> it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself  but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an expression of general complaisance  and in all that he said  she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions  as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed  however temporary its existence might prove  had at least outlived one day <EOS> <EOS> 282.7311034393949
<SOS> <SOS> when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance  and courting the good opinion of people  with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace  when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage  the difference  the change was so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible <EOS> <EOS> 321.4004882036823
<SOS> <SOS> never  even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield  or his dignified relations at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to please  so free from self consequence  or unbending reserve as now  when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed  would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings <EOS> <EOS> 297.53159563502766
<SOS> <SOS> missarcy  though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations  readily obeyed <EOS> <EOS> 295.5311967617761
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner looked at her niece  desirous of knowing how  she   whom the invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its acceptance  but elizabeth had turned away her head <EOS> <EOS> 437.5618811119147
<SOS> <SOS> presuming  however  that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment  than any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who was fond of society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she ventured to engage for her attendance  and the day after the next was fixed on <EOS> <EOS> 305.83587076790826
<SOS> <SOS> bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again  having still a great deal to say to her  and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends <EOS> <EOS> 281.13956098212054
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister  was pleased  and on this account  as well as some others  found herself  when their visitors left them  capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction  though while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been little <EOS> <EOS> 224.23749780705253
<SOS> <SOS> but she had no reason to fear mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 141.84422712291828
<SOS> <SOS> it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of  it was evident that he was very much in love with her <EOS> <EOS> 78.50319272191156
<SOS> <SOS> they saw much to interest  but nothing to justify enquiry <EOS> <EOS> 344.0860260493538
<SOS> <SOS> of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and  as far as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find <EOS> <EOS> 132.8641556447806
<SOS> <SOS> they could not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn his character from their own feelings  and his servant s report  without any reference to any other account  the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known  would not have recognised it for mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 129.72348368056439
<SOS> <SOS> there was now an interest  however  in believing the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible  that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old  and whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be hastily rejected <EOS> <EOS> 287.53461337329145
<SOS> <SOS> neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends  that could materially lessen its weight <EOS> <EOS> 453.9452200287925
<SOS> <SOS> they had nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably had  and if not  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town  where the family did not visit <EOS> <EOS> 262.9364178887178
<SOS> <SOS> it was acknowledged  however  that he was a liberal man  and did much good among the poor <EOS> <EOS> 150.47597752468823
<SOS> <SOS> with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation  for though the chief of his concerns  with the son of his patron  were imperfectly understood  it was yet a well known fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he had left many debts behind him  which mr darcy afterwards discharged <EOS> <EOS> 246.3172912720409
<SOS> <SOS> as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last  and the evening  though as it passed it seemed long  was not long enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion  and she lay awake two whole hours  endeavouring to make them out <EOS> <EOS> 357.77717514971613
<SOS> <SOS> she certainly did not hate him <EOS> <EOS> 186.61781805009298
<SOS> <SOS> no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  that could be so called <EOS> <EOS> 287.3759422775932
<SOS> <SOS> the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings  and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony so highly in his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light  which yesterday had produced <EOS> <EOS> 271.8147079700627
<SOS> <SOS> but above all  above respect and esteem  there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked <EOS> <EOS> 338.3831808647429
<SOS> <SOS> it was gratitude <EOS> <EOS> 136.66890166306686
<SOS> <SOS> gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  but for loving her still well enough  to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection <EOS> <EOS> 277.1150361100891
<SOS> <SOS> he who  she had been persuaded  would avoid her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental meeting  most eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any indelicate display of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where their two selves only were concerned  was soliciting the good opinion of her friends  and bent on making her known to his sister <EOS> <EOS> 252.55043122986504
<SOS> <SOS> such a change in a man of so much pride  excited not only astonishment but gratitude  for to love  ardent love  it must be attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be exactly defined <EOS> <EOS> 208.05299481908014
<SOS> <SOS> she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to him  she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself  and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power  which her fancy told her she still possessed  of bringing on the renewal of his addresses <EOS> <EOS> 204.50300957285452
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was pleased  though  when she asked herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply <EOS> <EOS> 154.44955057131543
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast <EOS> <EOS> 283.1686605354562
<SOS> <SOS> the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon <EOS> <EOS> 360.91483158344585
<SOS> <SOS> on reaching the house  they were shewn through the hall into the saloon  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer <EOS> <EOS> 587.9585858640178
<SOS> <SOS> hurst and missingley  and the lady with whom she lived in london <EOS> <EOS> 193.92251601408756
<SOS> <SOS> georgiana s reception of them was very civil  but attended with all that embarrassment which  though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior  the belief of her being proud and reserved <EOS> <EOS> 379.1355004319977

<SOS> <SOS> gardiner  with occasional help from elizabeth  the conversation was carried on <EOS> <EOS> 389.89787445562115
<SOS> <SOS> missarcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a short sentence  when there was least danger of its being heard <EOS> <EOS> 384.35860209310016
<SOS> <SOS> her own thoughts were employing her <EOS> <EOS> 108.47193387641472
<SOS> <SOS> she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room <EOS> <EOS> 219.89362800092633
<SOS> <SOS> she wished  she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them  and whether she wished or feared it most  she could scarcely determine <EOS> <EOS> 281.2649478192724
<SOS> <SOS> after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour  without hearing missingley s voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family <EOS> <EOS> 278.301461246379
<SOS> <SOS> she answered with equal indifference and brevity  and the other said no more <EOS> <EOS> 177.4860889608148
<SOS> <SOS> annesley to missarcy had been given  to remind her of her post <EOS> <EOS> 223.1182621086519
<SOS> <SOS> there was now employment for the whole party  for though they could not all talk  they could all eat  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes  nectarines  and peaches  soon collected them round the table <EOS> <EOS> 154.63205330091952
<SOS> <SOS> while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  and then  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate  she began to regret that he came <EOS> <EOS> 176.66401450250646
<SOS> <SOS> no sooner did he appear  than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed   a resolution the more necessary to be made  but perhaps not the more easily kept  because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them  and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room <EOS> <EOS> 305.1985929680891
<SOS> <SOS> in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in missingley s  in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over <EOS> <EOS> 267.232281808184
<SOS> <SOS> missarcy  on her brother s entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted  and forwarded  as much as possible  every attempt at conversation on either side <EOS> <EOS> 242.7741863810313
<SOS> <SOS> missingley saw all this likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the first opportunity of saying  with sneering civility   pray  missliza  are not the     shire militia removed from meryton <EOS> <EOS> 374.4000001626915
<SOS> <SOS> in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name  but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts  and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress  but  exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack  she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone <EOS> <EOS> 295.05221517218666
<SOS> <SOS> while she spoke  an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion  earnestly looking at her  and his sister overcome with confusion  and unable to lift up her eyes <EOS> <EOS> 455.00195537441977
<SOS> <SOS> had missingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth  by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion  and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities  by which some part of her family were connected with that corps <EOS> <EOS> 218.61136097634298
<SOS> <SOS> not a syllable had ever reached her of missarcy s meditated elopement <EOS> <EOS> 355.14613148816716
<SOS> <SOS> to no creature had it been revealed  where secresy was possible  except to elizabeth  and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it  from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming hereafter her own <EOS> <EOS> 288.4524414791731
<SOS> <SOS> he had certainly formed such a plan  and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from missennet  it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend <EOS> <EOS> 217.81948437572206
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his emotion  and as missingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not approach nearer to wickham  georgiana also recovered in time  though not enough to be able to speak any more <EOS> <EOS> 477.1967688765531
<SOS> <SOS> her brother  whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely recollected her interest in the affair  and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth  seemed to have fixed them on her more  and more cheerfully <EOS> <EOS> 243.9577061197673
<SOS> <SOS> but georgiana would not join her <EOS> <EOS> 159.64340966212345
<SOS> <SOS> her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour  his judgment could not err  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth  as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable <EOS> <EOS> 266.77342967521696
<SOS> <SOS> when darcy returned to the saloon  missingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister <EOS> <EOS> 119.6206837766987

<SOS> <SOS> however little mr darcy might have liked such an address  he contented himself with coolly replying  that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned   no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer <EOS> <EOS> 330.95292992395025
<SOS> <SOS> her face is too thin  her complexion has no brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome <EOS> <EOS> 305.1947655328504
<SOS> <SOS> her nose wants character  there is nothing marked in its lines <EOS> <EOS> 316.7458190372771
<SOS> <SOS> her teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them <EOS> <EOS> 259.9519364493051
<SOS> <SOS> they have a sharp  shrewish look  which i do not like at all  and in her air altogether  there is a self sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable <EOS> <EOS> 180.81353086929596
<SOS> <SOS> he was resolutely silent however  and  from a determination of making him speak  she continued   i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been dining at netherfield    she  a beauty <EOS> <EOS> 377.29058530425255
<SOS> <SOS> but afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time <EOS> <EOS> 204.65789777778525
<SOS> <SOS> yes   replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but  that  was only when i first knew her  for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance <EOS> <EOS> 261.34081892428526

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was not surprised at it  as jane had written the direction remarkably ill <EOS> <EOS> 210.73007933517496
<SOS> <SOS> they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off by themselves <EOS> <EOS> 288.75845514649296
<SOS> <SOS> the one missent must be first attended to  it had been written five days ago <EOS> <EOS> 324.2887445010421
<SOS> <SOS> the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements  with such news as the country afforded  but the latter half  which was dated a day later  and written in evident agitation  gave more important intelligence <EOS> <EOS> 456.78595192910683
<SOS> <SOS> it was to this effect        since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of alarming      you  be assured that we are all well <EOS> <EOS> 312.5460486760978
<SOS> <SOS> what i have to say relates to      poor lydia <EOS> <EOS> 185.91334009599484
<SOS> <SOS> an express came at twelve last night  just as we were      all gone to bed  from colonel forster  to inform us that she was      gone off to scotland with one of his officers  to own the truth       with wickham <EOS> <EOS> 276.49639280210516
<SOS> <SOS> imagine our surprise <EOS> <EOS> 654.0272056772513
<SOS> <SOS> to kitty  however  it does not      seem so wholly unexpected <EOS> <EOS> 314.9051847168983
<SOS> <SOS> i am very  very sorry <EOS> <EOS> 91.07054289039502
<SOS> <SOS> so imprudent a      match on both sides <EOS> <EOS> 502.8372063106602
<SOS> <SOS> but i am willing to hope the best  and that      his character has been misunderstood <EOS> <EOS> 136.66588237152047
<SOS> <SOS> thoughtless and indiscreet i      can easily believe him  but this step  and let us rejoice over it       marks nothing bad at heart <EOS> <EOS> 547.0362938089809
<SOS> <SOS> his choice is disinterested at least       for he must know my father can give her nothing <EOS> <EOS> 236.7050783228422
<SOS> <SOS> how thankful am i       that we never let them know what has been said against him  we must      forget it ourselves <EOS> <EOS> 370.0429322096913
<SOS> <SOS> my dear lizzy  they must      have passed within ten miles of us <EOS> <EOS> 298.0114702347378
<SOS> <SOS> i must conclude  for i cannot be      long from my poor mother <EOS> <EOS> 180.68089718091676
<SOS> <SOS> i am afraid you will not be able to make      it out  but i hardly know what i have written <EOS> <EOS> 74.06454483029842
<SOS> <SOS> by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried      letter  i wish this may be more intelligible  but though not      confined for time  my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer      for being coherent <EOS> <EOS> 223.56713528629044
<SOS> <SOS> dearest lizzy  i hardly know what i would      write  but i have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed <EOS> <EOS> 207.56989974503256
<SOS> <SOS> though lydia s short      letter to mr <EOS> <EOS> 282.4035224555032
<SOS> <SOS> f <EOS> <EOS> 296.1966347911352
<SOS> <SOS> gave them to understand that they were going to      gretna green  something was dropped by denny expressing his belief      that w <EOS> <EOS> 443.0233677767851
<SOS> <SOS> never intended to go there  or to marry lydia at all  which      was repeated to colonel f <EOS> <EOS> 332.6649552514245
<SOS> <SOS> who instantly taking the alarm  set off      from b <EOS> <EOS> 419.2518480987458
<SOS> <SOS> intending to trace their route <EOS> <EOS> 363.48225145108313
<SOS> <SOS> after making      every possible enquiry on that side london  colonel f <EOS> <EOS> 760.8372510349978
<SOS> <SOS> came on into      hertfordshire  anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes  and at      the inns in barnet and hatfield  but without any success  no such      people had been seen to pass through <EOS> <EOS> 244.0204557928994
<SOS> <SOS> but no one can throw any blame on them <EOS> <EOS> 270.2469932660168
<SOS> <SOS> our distress  my      dear lizzy  is very great <EOS> <EOS> 169.56355381342874
<SOS> <SOS> my father and mother believe the worst       but i cannot think so ill of him <EOS> <EOS> 158.32322200393963
<SOS> <SOS> many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan  and even if  he  could form such a design      against a young woman of lydia s connections  which is not likely       can i suppose her so lost to every thing <EOS> <EOS> 268.7204566936992
<SOS> <SOS> impossible <EOS> <EOS> 236.29693794429136
<SOS> <SOS> i grieve to      find  however  that colonel f <EOS> <EOS> 343.34500225430565
<SOS> <SOS> is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage  he shook his head when i expressed my hopes  and said he      feared w <EOS> <EOS> 431.82525496563426
<SOS> <SOS> was not a man to be trusted <EOS> <EOS> 121.61172370971087
<SOS> <SOS> my poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room <EOS> <EOS> 324.2686620266453
<SOS> <SOS> could she exert herself it would be better  but      this is not to be expected  and as to my father  i never in my life      saw him so affected <EOS> <EOS> 129.74772456314565
<SOS> <SOS> poor kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment  but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder <EOS> <EOS> 357.6734033268917
<SOS> <SOS> i am not so      selfish  however  as to press for it  if inconvenient <EOS> <EOS> 170.08125155066566
<SOS> <SOS> i      take up my pen again to do  what i have just told you i would not       but circumstances are such  that i cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here  as soon as possible <EOS> <EOS> 241.84213196296676
<SOS> <SOS> i know my dear uncle and      aunt so well  that i am not afraid of requesting it  though i have      still something more to ask of the former <EOS> <EOS> 119.77270963201487
<SOS> <SOS> my father is going to      london with colonel forster instantly  to try to discover her <EOS> <EOS> 232.99335902939606
<SOS> <SOS> what      he means to do  i am sure i know not  but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way  and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again      to morrow evening <EOS> <EOS> 184.09711227415096
<SOS> <SOS> in such an exigence my uncle s advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world  he will immediately      comprehend what i must feel  and i rely upon his goodness <EOS> <EOS> 171.90642519070596
<SOS> <SOS> where  where is my uncle <EOS> <EOS> 252.7246488874452
<SOS> <SOS> her pale face and impetuous manner made him start  and before he could recover himself enough to speak  she  in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation  hastily exclaimed   i beg your pardon  but i must leave you <EOS> <EOS> 380.0544074852611
<SOS> <SOS> i must find mr gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i have not an instant to lose <EOS> <EOS> 221.36939685416317
<SOS> <SOS> good god <EOS> <EOS> 343.3465575945525
<SOS> <SOS> what is the matter <EOS> <EOS> 112.59897103903225
<SOS> <SOS> cried he  with more feeling than politeness  then recollecting himself   i will not detain you a minute  but let me  or let the servant  go after mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 453.5763755694529
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner <EOS> <EOS> 198.2305811490288
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her  and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them <EOS> <EOS> 184.00510894725187
<SOS> <SOS> is there nothing you could take  to give you present relief <EOS> <EOS> 328.7119066819987
<SOS> <SOS> a glass of wine   shall i get you one <EOS> <EOS> 334.0124420993206
<SOS> <SOS> no  i thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself <EOS> <EOS> 434.35634881901524
<SOS> <SOS> there is nothing the matter with me <EOS> <EOS> 132.37623329222757
<SOS> <SOS> she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes could not speak another word <EOS> <EOS> 315.5733773276377
<SOS> <SOS> darcy  in wretched suspense  could only say something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her in compassionate silence <EOS> <EOS> 355.95711379995737
<SOS> <SOS> i have just had a letter from jane  with such dreadful news <EOS> <EOS> 227.73318542218183
<SOS> <SOS> it cannot be concealed from any one <EOS> <EOS> 137.07786347767762
<SOS> <SOS> my youngest sister has left all her friends  has eloped   has thrown herself into the power of  of mr wickham <EOS> <EOS> 210.98902420078065
<SOS> <SOS> she has no money  no connections  nothing that can tempt him to  she is lost for ever <EOS> <EOS> 252.16626787571104
<SOS> <SOS> when i consider   she added  in a yet more agitated voice   that  i  might have prevented it <EOS> <EOS> 228.77116578887933
<SOS> <SOS> i  who knew what he was <EOS> <EOS> 101.9616865115832
<SOS> <SOS> i am grieved  indeed   cried darcy   grieved  shocked <EOS> <EOS> 666.3665377789307
<SOS> <SOS> but is it certain  absolutely certain <EOS> <EOS> 427.32791532029006
<SOS> <SOS> oh yes <EOS> <EOS> 263.52718268373434
<SOS> <SOS> and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover her <EOS> <EOS> 113.32755517858837
<SOS> <SOS> but nothing can be done  i know very well that nothing can be done <EOS> <EOS> 164.9303639010551
<SOS> <SOS> how is such a man to be worked on <EOS> <EOS> 116.42019302113893
<SOS> <SOS> how are they even to be discovered <EOS> <EOS> 253.60653879402278
<SOS> <SOS> i have not the smallest hope <EOS> <EOS> 127.2969909329609
<SOS> <SOS> it is every way horrible <EOS> <EOS> 110.83014809993287
<SOS> <SOS> when  my  eyes were opened to his real character <EOS> <EOS> 227.67173762963384
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> but i knew not  i was afraid of doing too much <EOS> <EOS> 169.12354643015908
<SOS> <SOS> wretched  wretched  mistake <EOS> <EOS> 811.9625117634931
<SOS> <SOS> he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow contracted  his air gloomy <EOS> <EOS> 238.1640856550323
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth soon observed  and instantly understood it <EOS> <EOS> 342.11840681417016
<SOS> <SOS> her power was sinking  every thing  must  sink under such a proof of family weakness  such an assurance of the deepest disgrace <EOS> <EOS> 341.4513578968841
<SOS> <SOS> she could neither wonder nor condemn  but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress <EOS> <EOS> 238.39048620504272
<SOS> <SOS> it was  on the contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him  as now  when all love must be vain <EOS> <EOS> 202.85701213845988
<SOS> <SOS> but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her <EOS> <EOS> 195.94333137129394
<SOS> <SOS> would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part  that might offer consolation to such distress <EOS> <EOS> 354.5671197620611
<SOS> <SOS> but i will not torment you with vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks <EOS> <EOS> 271.6041024904991
<SOS> <SOS> this unfortunate affair will  i fear  prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day <EOS> <EOS> 347.8063923973273
<SOS> <SOS> be so kind as to apologize for us to missarcy <EOS> <EOS> 179.6043859814148
<SOS> <SOS> say that urgent business calls us home immediately <EOS> <EOS> 632.0619581401536
<SOS> <SOS> conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible <EOS> <EOS> 312.64167802776257
<SOS> <SOS> i know it cannot be long <EOS> <EOS> 103.67821084815019
<SOS> <SOS> he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow for her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her relations  with only one serious  parting  look  went away <EOS> <EOS> 419.41510551246773
<SOS> <SOS> as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance  so full of contradictions and varieties  sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance  and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination <EOS> <EOS> 257.45635451375244
<SOS> <SOS> if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection  elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty <EOS> <EOS> 460.70525952673626
<SOS> <SOS> but if otherwise  if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural  in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object  and even before two words have been exchanged  nothing can be said in her defence  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method  in her partiality for wickham  and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment <EOS> <EOS> 340.2945122638717
<SOS> <SOS> be that as it may  she saw him go with regret  and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business <EOS> <EOS> 408.28472709099634
<SOS> <SOS> never  since reading jane s second letter  had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her <EOS> <EOS> 279.33332261786023
<SOS> <SOS> no one but jane  she thought  could flatter herself with such an expectation <EOS> <EOS> 213.56012364780116
<SOS> <SOS> surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement <EOS> <EOS> 173.18714576861598
<SOS> <SOS> while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind  she was all surprise  all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl  whom it was impossible he could marry for money  and how lydia could ever have attached him  had appeared incomprehensible <EOS> <EOS> 293.23451761349105
<SOS> <SOS> she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire  that lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body <EOS> <EOS> 159.57319133840133
<SOS> <SOS> sometimes one officer  sometimes another had been her favourite  as their attentions raised them in her opinion <EOS> <EOS> 475.7918984351009
<SOS> <SOS> her affections had been continually fluctuating  but never without an object <EOS> <EOS> 293.12766790773753
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> she was wild to be at home  to hear  to see  to be upon the spot  to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her  in a family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable of exertion  and requiring constant attendance  and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia  her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance  and till he entered the room  the misery of her impatience was severe <EOS> <EOS> 234.71893198867377
<SOS> <SOS> mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 208.4382848617228
<SOS> <SOS> though lydia had never been a favourite with them  mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 172.18426609176038
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner could not but be deeply affected <EOS> <EOS> 406.16689714037074
<SOS> <SOS> not lydia only  but all were concerned in it  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror  mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power <EOS> <EOS> 271.95161391653807
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  though expecting no less  thanked him with tears of gratitude  and all three being actuated by one spirit  every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled <EOS> <EOS> 423.2132663019086
<SOS> <SOS> they were to be off as soon as possible <EOS> <EOS> 121.19008623005196
<SOS> <SOS> but what is to be done about pemberley <EOS> <EOS> 166.3824518513689
<SOS> <SOS> cried mr <EOS> <EOS> 336.1168769352191
<SOS> <SOS> john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us   was it so <EOS> <EOS> 245.96946691176217
<SOS> <SOS> yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement <EOS> <EOS> 175.61797505597664
<SOS> <SOS> that is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her room to prepare <EOS> <EOS> 187.7476504023403
<SOS> <SOS> and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth <EOS> <EOS> 213.36987498767772
<SOS> <SOS> oh  that i knew how it was <EOS> <EOS> 112.11226515960897
<SOS> <SOS> had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle  she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself  but she had her share of business as well as her aunt  and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton  with false excuses for their sudden departure <EOS> <EOS> 206.49860507380075
<SOS> <SOS> it appears to me so very unlikely  that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was actually staying in his colonel s family  that i am strongly inclined to hope the best <EOS> <EOS> 220.25830064428382
<SOS> <SOS> could he expect that her friends would not step forward <EOS> <EOS> 305.44716235684314
<SOS> <SOS> could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster <EOS> <EOS> 242.11900747324145
<SOS> <SOS> his temptation is not adequate to the risk <EOS> <EOS> 98.14874306053132
<SOS> <SOS> do you really think so <EOS> <EOS> 152.41366751174417
<SOS> <SOS> cried elizabeth  brightening up for a moment <EOS> <EOS> 159.85808281118398
<SOS> <SOS> upon my word   said mr <EOS> <EOS> 277.14875831808007
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner   i begin to be of your uncle s opinion <EOS> <EOS> 134.7537802085701
<SOS> <SOS> i cannot think so very ill of wickham <EOS> <EOS> 131.27206607928264
<SOS> <SOS> can you  yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him up  as to believe him capable of it <EOS> <EOS> 280.91474137939673
<SOS> <SOS> not perhaps of neglecting his own interest <EOS> <EOS> 295.2769091697499
<SOS> <SOS> if  indeed  it should be so <EOS> <EOS> 105.95885076825024
<SOS> <SOS> but i dare not hope it <EOS> <EOS> 93.40760455643169
<SOS> <SOS> in the first place   replied mr gardiner   there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland <EOS> <EOS> 164.52940306994114
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption <EOS> <EOS> 302.50626139307514
<SOS> <SOS> well  then  supposing them to be in london <EOS> <EOS> 174.11386009705248
<SOS> <SOS> but why all this secrecy <EOS> <EOS> 253.29406946498716
<SOS> <SOS> why any fear of detection <EOS> <EOS> 354.442987007916
<SOS> <SOS> why must their marriage be private <EOS> <EOS> 451.67666690935226
<SOS> <SOS> no  no  this is not likely <EOS> <EOS> 303.3763076040214
<SOS> <SOS> his most particular friend  you see by jane s account  was persuaded of his never intending to marry her <EOS> <EOS> 199.80504246540096
<SOS> <SOS> he cannot afford it <EOS> <EOS> 177.30298545809134
<SOS> <SOS> and what claims has lydia  what attractions has she beyond youth  health  and good humour  that could make him for her sake  forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well <EOS> <EOS> 397.76707055482353
<SOS> <SOS> as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce <EOS> <EOS> 232.82347008077454
<SOS> <SOS> but as to your other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good <EOS> <EOS> 217.32515120282488
<SOS> <SOS> lydia has no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from my father s behaviour  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family  that  he  would do as little  and think as little about it  as any father could do  in such a matter <EOS> <EOS> 197.58269816044555
<SOS> <SOS> but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him  as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage <EOS> <EOS> 157.71624657925543
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps i am not doing her justice <EOS> <EOS> 176.45116655747225

<SOS> <SOS> susceptibility to her feelings  which are naturally lively enough <EOS> <EOS> 230.75676220655097
<SOS> <SOS> but you see that jane   said her aunt   does not think so ill of wickham  as to believe him capable of the attempt <EOS> <EOS> 136.8428473081135
<SOS> <SOS> of whom does jane ever think ill <EOS> <EOS> 325.21102017994264
<SOS> <SOS> but jane knows  as well as i do  what wickham really is <EOS> <EOS> 191.7632279431992
<SOS> <SOS> we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word <EOS> <EOS> 100.62256705240654
<SOS> <SOS> that he has neither integrity nor honour <EOS> <EOS> 371.35037817986273

<SOS> <SOS> and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty  which it is not worth while to relate  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless <EOS> <EOS> 202.8578968569404
<SOS> <SOS> from what he said of missarcy  i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved  disagreeable girl <EOS> <EOS> 383.42376792233057
<SOS> <SOS> yet he knew to the contrary himself <EOS> <EOS> 180.82844387467367
<SOS> <SOS> he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her <EOS> <EOS> 91.48008971283976

<SOS> <SOS> every girl in  or near meryton  was out of her senses about him for the first two months  but he never distinguished  her  by any particular attention  and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her favourites <EOS> <EOS> 359.9607529070347
<SOS> <SOS> from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent <EOS> <EOS> 158.1878118735541
<SOS> <SOS> fixed there by the keenest of all anguish  self reproach  she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness <EOS> <EOS> 302.9827653835702
<SOS> <SOS> it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations <EOS> <EOS> 92.57354310179701
<SOS> <SOS> the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were standing on the steps of the house  as they entered the paddock  and when the carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces  and displayed itself over their whole bodies  in a variety of capers and frisks  was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome <EOS> <EOS> 220.86731193145886
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them an hasty kiss  hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment  immediately met her <EOS> <EOS> 366.2969255663229
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears filled the eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives <EOS> <EOS> 225.86657448240905
<SOS> <SOS> not yet   replied jane <EOS> <EOS> 255.17922470733973

<SOS> <SOS> you look pale <EOS> <EOS> 381.6356610217032
<SOS> <SOS> the sanguine hope of good  however  which the benevolence of her heart suggested  had not yet deserted her  she still expected that it would all end well  and that every morning would bring some letter  either from lydia or her father  to explain their proceedings  and perhaps announce the marriage <EOS> <EOS> 268.78497179114174
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few minutes conversation together  received them exactly as might be expected  with tears and lamentations of regret  invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham  and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage  blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing <EOS> <EOS> 417.84178910473025
<SOS> <SOS> i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing  if she had been well looked after <EOS> <EOS> 112.92379996419031
<SOS> <SOS> poor dear child <EOS> <EOS> 541.7479338046223

<SOS> <SOS> they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr gardiner  after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family  told her that he meant to be in london the very next day  and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia <EOS> <EOS> 203.6797830956503
<SOS> <SOS> do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it as certain <EOS> <EOS> 220.70908604182273
<SOS> <SOS> in a few days more  we may gain some news of them  and till we know that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not let us give the matter over as lost <EOS> <EOS> 285.32831174633907
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> my dear brother   replied mr <EOS> <EOS> 212.73437471838423
<SOS> <SOS> and now do  when you get to town  find them out  wherever they may be  and if they are not married already   make  them marry <EOS> <EOS> 320.4050192801671
<SOS> <SOS> and as for wedding clothes  do not let them wait for that  but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses  to buy them  after they are married <EOS> <EOS> 351.5405373757055
<SOS> <SOS> and  above all things  keep mr bennet from fighting <EOS> <EOS> 205.6279249947612
<SOS> <SOS> tell him what a dreadful state i am in   that i am frightened out of my wits  and have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me  such spasms in my side  and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that i can get no rest by night nor by day <EOS> <EOS> 183.22402112516224
<SOS> <SOS> and tell my dear lydia  not to give any directions about her clothes  till she has seen me  for she does not know which are the best warehouses <EOS> <EOS> 200.87296615818133
<SOS> <SOS> oh  brother  how kind you are <EOS> <EOS> 356.00230321859806
<SOS> <SOS> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not attempt to oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants  while they waited at table  and judged it better that  one  only of the household  and the one whom they could most trust  should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject <EOS> <EOS> 193.4235759489652
<SOS> <SOS> in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments  to make their appearance before <EOS> <EOS> 229.57689930840914
<SOS> <SOS> the faces of both  however  were tolerably calm  and no change was visible in either  except that the loss of her favourite sister  or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business  had given something more of fretfulness than usual  to the accents of kitty <EOS> <EOS> 251.52307385811633
<SOS> <SOS> but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other  the balm of sisterly consolation <EOS> <EOS> 149.89320933236687
<SOS> <SOS> then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she added   unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from it this useful lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable  that one false step involves her in endless ruin  that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful   and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex <EOS> <EOS> 291.86032288552025
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much oppressed to make any reply <EOS> <EOS> 287.48470536486565
<SOS> <SOS> mary  however  continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them <EOS> <EOS> 251.58007363764565
<SOS> <SOS> after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event  which elizabeth considered as all but certain  and missennet could not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued the subject  by saying   but tell me all and every thing about it  which i have not already heard <EOS> <EOS> 314.0308765680893
<SOS> <SOS> give me farther particulars <EOS> <EOS> 513.1217956079511

<SOS> <SOS> i am so grieved for him <EOS> <EOS> 93.55282489826301
<SOS> <SOS> he  was  coming to us  in order to assure us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland  when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened his journey <EOS> <EOS> 277.01704397183653
<SOS> <SOS> did he know of their intending to go off <EOS> <EOS> 209.56393614340882
<SOS> <SOS> had colonel forster seen denny himself <EOS> <EOS> 664.9348423914568
<SOS> <SOS> yes  but when questioned by  him  denny denied knowing any thing of their plan  and would not give his real opinion about it <EOS> <EOS> 327.77211217222
<SOS> <SOS> he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying  and from  that   i am inclined to hope  he might have been misunderstood before <EOS> <EOS> 137.44138181218673
<SOS> <SOS> i felt a little uneasy  a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right <EOS> <EOS> 158.09298615664403
<SOS> <SOS> my father and mother knew nothing of that  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be <EOS> <EOS> 238.51375317022493
<SOS> <SOS> kitty then owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us  that in lydia s last letter  she had prepared her for such a step <EOS> <EOS> 228.5946615361399

<SOS> <SOS> does he know his real character <EOS> <EOS> 256.4141813643992
<SOS> <SOS> he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant <EOS> <EOS> 129.16970834629743
<SOS> <SOS> and since this sad affair has taken place  it is said  that he left meryton greatly in debt  but i hope this may be false <EOS> <EOS> 368.2514338612103
<SOS> <SOS> oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of him  this could not have happened <EOS> <EOS> 326.9931734104688

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  though she did not credit above half of what was said  believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain  and even jane  who believed still less of it  became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come  when if they had gone to scotland  which she had never before entirely despaired of  they must in all probability have gained some news of them <EOS> <EOS> 307.84887552235693
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday  on tuesday  his wife received a letter from him  it told them  that on his arrival  he had immediately found out his brother  and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street <EOS> <EOS> 288.5096608095121
<SOS> <SOS> that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham  before his arrival  but without gaining any satisfactory information  and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town  as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them  on their first coming to london  before they procured lodgings <EOS> <EOS> 203.43137234445422
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it <EOS> <EOS> 215.34799691738345
<SOS> <SOS> there was also a postscript to this effect <EOS> <EOS> 205.92821195146652
<SOS> <SOS> i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out  if possible  from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment  whether wickham has any relations or connections  who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself <EOS> <EOS> 192.688611311073

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature  as the compliment deserved <EOS> <EOS> 217.35574176002908
<SOS> <SOS> every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected <EOS> <EOS> 216.152045113901
<SOS> <SOS> the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience <EOS> <EOS> 222.31767458334028
<SOS> <SOS> through letters  whatever of good or bad was to be told  would be communicated  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance <EOS> <EOS> 420.35524373942826
<SOS> <SOS> but before they heard again from mr gardiner  a letter arrived for their father  from a different quarter  from mr collins  which  as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence  she accordingly read  and elizabeth  who knew what curiosities his letters always were  looked over her  and read it likewise <EOS> <EOS> 263.74103742377395
<SOS> <SOS> it was as follows        my dear sir        i feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation      in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from hertfordshire <EOS> <EOS> 318.7503734355495
<SOS> <SOS> collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you  and all your respectable      family  in your present distress  which must be of the bitterest      kind  because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove <EOS> <EOS> 262.6730414548781

<SOS> <SOS> the death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this <EOS> <EOS> 94.58450525987918
<SOS> <SOS> and it is the more to be lamented  because there is reason to      suppose  as my dear charlotte informs me  that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter  has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence  though  at the same time  for the consolation of      yourself and mr <EOS> <EOS> 150.37954004492164
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  i am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad  or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity  at so early an age <EOS> <EOS> 146.8707756289316
<SOS> <SOS> howsoever that may be  you      are grievously to be pitied  in which opinion i am not only joined      by mr <EOS> <EOS> 139.07552056172713

<SOS> <SOS> they agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter  will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others  for who  as lady      catherine herself condescendingly says  will connect themselves      with such a family <EOS> <EOS> 203.2019511096541

<SOS> <SOS> hill began instantly to express her joy <EOS> <EOS> 512.7830443656276
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this folly  took refuge in her own room  that she might think with freedom <EOS> <EOS> 221.40608145949392
<SOS> <SOS> poor lydia s situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it was no worse  she had need to be thankful <EOS> <EOS> 272.81336387713515
<SOS> <SOS> she felt it so  and though  in looking forward  neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity  could be justly expected for her sister  in looking back to what they had feared  only two hours ago  she felt all the advantages of what they had gained <EOS> <EOS> 348.79156034221006
<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet had very often wished  before this period of his life  that  instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an annual sum  for the better provision of his children  and of his wife  if she survived him <EOS> <EOS> 165.40163843368788
<SOS> <SOS> he now wished it more than ever <EOS> <EOS> 286.6314520171659
<SOS> <SOS> the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband  might then have rested in its proper place <EOS> <EOS> 232.17156939244757
<SOS> <SOS> he was seriously concerned  that a cause of so little advantage to any one  should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law  and he was determined  if possible  to find out the extent of his assistance  and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could <EOS> <EOS> 173.62274547375117
<SOS> <SOS> this son was to join in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should be of age  and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for <EOS> <EOS> 242.28223397009634
<SOS> <SOS> five daughters successively entered the world  but yet the son was to come  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 315.36659494502896

<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had no turn for economy  and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income <EOS> <EOS> 303.73644463185434
<SOS> <SOS> five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mr <EOS> <EOS> 728.3691171795698
<SOS> <SOS> bennet and the children <EOS> <EOS> 152.61664013167157
<SOS> <SOS> he had never before supposed that  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter  it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself  as by the present arrangement <EOS> <EOS> 175.24897027149953
<SOS> <SOS> his letter was soon dispatched  for though dilatory in undertaking business  he was quick in its execution <EOS> <EOS> 252.73579330046877
<SOS> <SOS> he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother  but was too angry with lydia  to send any message to her <EOS> <EOS> 177.6087611396283
<SOS> <SOS> the good news quickly spread through the house  and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood <EOS> <EOS> 259.654430232637
<SOS> <SOS> but there was much to be talked of  in marrying her  and the good natured wishes for her well doing  which had proceeded before  from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton  lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances  because with such an husband  her misery was considered certain <EOS> <EOS> 273.80476039023023
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had been down stairs  but on this happy day  she again took her seat at the head of her table  and in spirits oppressively high <EOS> <EOS> 242.3247374418282
<SOS> <SOS> no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph <EOS> <EOS> 198.53454631240461
<SOS> <SOS> the marriage of a daughter  which had been the first object of her wishes  since jane was sixteen  was now on the point of accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new carriages  and servants <EOS> <EOS> 222.30641447233094
<SOS> <SOS> she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter  and  without knowing or considering what their income might be  rejected many as deficient in size and importance <EOS> <EOS> 306.1212497751056
<SOS> <SOS> haye park might do   said she   if the gouldings would quit it  or the great house at stoke  if the drawing room were larger  but ashworth is too far off <EOS> <EOS> 291.27307417399874
<SOS> <SOS> i could not bear to have her ten miles from me  and as for purvis lodge  the attics are dreadful <EOS> <EOS> 144.05014924486434
<SOS> <SOS> her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption  while the servants remained <EOS> <EOS> 369.0118401448972
<SOS> <SOS> but when they had withdrawn  he said to her   mr <EOS> <EOS> 202.9831050713154
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  before you take any  or all of these houses  for your son and daughter  let us come to a right understanding <EOS> <EOS> 394.4432443379976
<SOS> <SOS> into  one  house in this neighbourhood  they shall never have admittance <EOS> <EOS> 223.463398780013
<SOS> <SOS> a long dispute followed this declaration  but mr bennet was firm  it soon led to another  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 380.26243246385945
<SOS> <SOS> bennet found  with amazement and horror  that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter <EOS> <EOS> 221.91795662065277
<SOS> <SOS> he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever  on the occasion <EOS> <EOS> 241.63236345906458
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet could hardly comprehend it <EOS> <EOS> 371.89613170554384
<SOS> <SOS> that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment  as to refuse his daughter a privilege  without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid  exceeded all that she could believe possible <EOS> <EOS> 259.7020743242348
<SOS> <SOS> she was more alive to the disgrace  which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials  than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham  a fortnight before they took place <EOS> <EOS> 232.09836133989668
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the distress of the moment  been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister  for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement  they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning  from all those who were not immediately on the spot <EOS> <EOS> 234.6482654471618
<SOS> <SOS> she had no fear of its spreading farther  through his means <EOS> <EOS> 137.39656330464916
<SOS> <SOS> there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended  but at the same time  there was no one  whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much <EOS> <EOS> 162.84869755388954
<SOS> <SOS> had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms  it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family  where to every other objection would now be added  an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned <EOS> <EOS> 215.8301319394017
<SOS> <SOS> from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink <EOS> <EOS> 91.75352549911067
<SOS> <SOS> the wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire  could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this <EOS> <EOS> 170.7728232663822
<SOS> <SOS> she became jealous of his esteem  when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it <EOS> <EOS> 167.55777412884038
<SOS> <SOS> what a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago  would now have been gladly and gratefully received <EOS> <EOS> 229.83896309273882
<SOS> <SOS> but while he was mortal  there must be a triumph <EOS> <EOS> 133.4058068717994
<SOS> <SOS> his understanding and temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her wishes <EOS> <EOS> 307.7551295595515
<SOS> <SOS> it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both  by her ease and liveliness  his mind might have been softened  his manners improved  and from his judgment  information  and knowledge of the world  she must have received benefit of greater importance <EOS> <EOS> 194.8787136853011
<SOS> <SOS> but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was <EOS> <EOS> 416.9247779975936
<SOS> <SOS> how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence  she could not imagine <EOS> <EOS> 170.05596647116138
<SOS> <SOS> mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother <EOS> <EOS> 169.6092223735031
<SOS> <SOS> to mr bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family  and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again <EOS> <EOS> 151.60653531126917
<SOS> <SOS> the principal purport of his letter was to inform them  that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia <EOS> <EOS> 153.33184151181254
<SOS> <SOS> it was greatly my wish that he should do so   he added   as soon      as his marriage was fixed on <EOS> <EOS> 172.99748630497336

<SOS> <SOS> he has given in all his debts  i hope      at least he has not deceived us <EOS> <EOS> 209.87166990779596
<SOS> <SOS> they will then join his regiment       unless they are first invited to longbourn  and i understand from      mr <EOS> <EOS> 367.15928363742563

<SOS> <SOS> mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the     shire  as clearly as mr gardiner could do <EOS> <EOS> 145.19386646506763
<SOS> <SOS> but mr <EOS> <EOS> 191.98837915673215
<SOS> <SOS> lydia s being settled in the north  just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company  for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire  was a severe disappointment  and besides  it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body  and had so many favourites <EOS> <EOS> 196.21049599392947

<SOS> <SOS> but jane and elizabeth  who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents  urged him so earnestly  yet so rationally and so mildly  to receive her and her husband at longbourn  as soon as they were married  that he was prevailed on to think as they thought  and act as they wished <EOS> <EOS> 154.0390071204174
<SOS> <SOS> and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing  that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood  before she was banished to the north <EOS> <EOS> 127.0376619748104

<SOS> <SOS> i was afraid they might not  and we overtook william goulding in his curricle  so i was determined he should know it  and so i let down the side glass next to him  and took off my glove  and let my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that he might see the ring  and then i bowed and smiled like any thing <EOS> <EOS> 296.6887415603191
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could bear it no longer <EOS> <EOS> 256.49914711255815

<SOS> <SOS> jane  i take your place now  and you must go lower  because i am a married woman <EOS> <EOS> 244.7429829148189
<SOS> <SOS> it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment  from which she had been so wholly free at first <EOS> <EOS> 136.8507955651337
<SOS> <SOS> her ease and good spirits increased <EOS> <EOS> 338.93577093768874

<SOS> <SOS> their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them <EOS> <EOS> 366.8802190918505
<SOS> <SOS> mr wickham had received his commission before he left london  and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight <EOS> <EOS> 136.2511821144961
<SOS> <SOS> no one but mr <EOS> <EOS> 214.83456110718544
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  regretted that their stay would be so short  and she made the most of the time  by visiting about with her daughter  and having very frequent parties at home <EOS> <EOS> 220.08988323111095
<SOS> <SOS> these parties were acceptable to all  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think  than such as did not <EOS> <EOS> 306.470143304418
<SOS> <SOS> wickham s affection for lydia  was just what elizabeth had expected to find it  not equal to lydia s for him <EOS> <EOS> 190.31463652299746
<SOS> <SOS> she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied  from the reason of things  that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love  rather than by his  and she would have wondered why  without violently caring for her  he chose to elope with her at all  had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and if that were the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion <EOS> <EOS> 217.88579211770343
<SOS> <SOS> lydia was exceedingly fond of him <EOS> <EOS> 169.9518587313178

<SOS> <SOS> he did every thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september  than any body else in the country <EOS> <EOS> 118.54102003320295
<SOS> <SOS> one morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with her two elder sisters  she said to elizabeth   lizzy  i never gave  you  an account of my wedding  i believe <EOS> <EOS> 249.1135368646894
<SOS> <SOS> you were not by  when i told mamma  and the others  all about it <EOS> <EOS> 232.77244553532478
<SOS> <SOS> no really   replied elizabeth   i think there cannot be too little said on the subject <EOS> <EOS> 193.38223123591868

<SOS> <SOS> you are so strange <EOS> <EOS> 183.2766858671506
<SOS> <SOS> but i must tell you how it went off <EOS> <EOS> 229.47617126888332
<SOS> <SOS> we were married  you know  at st <EOS> <EOS> 209.9465317869794
<SOS> <SOS> clement s  because wickham s lodgings were in that parish <EOS> <EOS> 228.94104159005943
<SOS> <SOS> my uncle and aunt and i were to go together  and the others were to meet us at the church <EOS> <EOS> 176.20396814373706
<SOS> <SOS> well  monday morning came  and i was in such a fuss <EOS> <EOS> 154.24401803213598
<SOS> <SOS> i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off  and then i should have gone quite distracted <EOS> <EOS> 271.2103275562747
<SOS> <SOS> and there was my aunt  all the time i was dressing  preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon <EOS> <EOS> 204.80081064169883
<SOS> <SOS> however  i did not hear above one word in ten  for i was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear wickham <EOS> <EOS> 195.11072423607254
<SOS> <SOS> well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  i thought it would never be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them <EOS> <EOS> 208.18679110376752
<SOS> <SOS> if you ll believe me  i did not once put my foot out of doors  though i was there a fortnight <EOS> <EOS> 236.09106875055338
<SOS> <SOS> to be sure london was rather thin  but however the little theatre was open <EOS> <EOS> 191.1471187277063
<SOS> <SOS> well  i was so frightened i did not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day <EOS> <EOS> 147.97950326291314
<SOS> <SOS> but  luckily  he came back again in ten minutes time  and then we all set out <EOS> <EOS> 451.6709756286407
<SOS> <SOS> however  i recollected afterwards  that if he  had  been prevented going  the wedding need not be put off  for mr darcy might have done as well <EOS> <EOS> 197.02386186453978
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 55.109369249021235
<SOS> <SOS> repeated elizabeth  in utter amazement <EOS> <EOS> 434.1983947564133
<SOS> <SOS> oh  yes <EOS> <EOS> 263.52718268373434
<SOS> <SOS> but gracious me <EOS> <EOS> 235.09320547969673
<SOS> <SOS> i quite forgot <EOS> <EOS> 341.4397600881163
<SOS> <SOS> i ought not to have said a word about it <EOS> <EOS> 131.73495504467152
<SOS> <SOS> i promised them so faithfully <EOS> <EOS> 140.75309163900135
<SOS> <SOS> what will wickham say <EOS> <EOS> 225.52963009381503
<SOS> <SOS> it was to be such a secret <EOS> <EOS> 76.35736233229146
<SOS> <SOS> if it was to be secret   said jane   say not another word on the subject <EOS> <EOS> 165.47790162712855
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> certainly   said elizabeth  though burning with curiosity   we will ask you no questions <EOS> <EOS> 324.1008235030027
<SOS> <SOS> thank you   said lydia   for if you did  i should certainly tell you all  and then wickham would be angry <EOS> <EOS> 229.11186094936264
<SOS> <SOS> on such encouragement to ask  elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power  by running away <EOS> <EOS> 238.79203589831278
<SOS> <SOS> but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at least it was impossible not to try for information <EOS> <EOS> 288.87805101015016
<SOS> <SOS> it was exactly a scene  and exactly among people  where he had apparently least to do  and least temptation to go <EOS> <EOS> 314.480631493033
<SOS> <SOS> she could not bear such suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  wrote a short letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended <EOS> <EOS> 218.8943421146367
<SOS> <SOS> you may readily comprehend   she added   what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and  comparatively speaking  a stranger to our family  should have been amongst you at such a time <EOS> <EOS> 255.88621388826516
<SOS> <SOS> not that i  shall  though   she added to herself  as she finished the letter   and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in an honourable manner  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out <EOS> <EOS> 137.689747977399
<SOS> <SOS> chapter x <EOS> <EOS> 360.5987644531657
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter  as soon as she possibly could <EOS> <EOS> 154.66250274694056
<SOS> <SOS> 6 <EOS> <EOS> 99.45567681017228
<SOS> <SOS> my dear niece        i have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it  as i foresee that a  little  writing will      not comprise what i have to tell you <EOS> <EOS> 127.04449314255659
<SOS> <SOS> i must confess myself      surprised by your application  i did not expect it from  you <EOS> <EOS> 198.70293124077946
<SOS> <SOS> don t think me angry  however  for i only mean to let you know       that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your       side <EOS> <EOS> 230.04536427814583
<SOS> <SOS> your uncle is as much surprised as i am  and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned  would have allowed      him to act as he has done <EOS> <EOS> 147.63460789869214
<SOS> <SOS> but if you are really innocent and      ignorant  i must be more explicit <EOS> <EOS> 201.50824735945739
<SOS> <SOS> on the very day of my coming      home from longbourn  your uncle had a most unexpected visitor <EOS> <EOS> 202.64705482837795
<SOS> <SOS> mr      darcy called  and was shut up with him several hours <EOS> <EOS> 272.14903357696676
<SOS> <SOS> it was all      over before i arrived  so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as  your s  seems to have been <EOS> <EOS> 170.83970950926218
<SOS> <SOS> from what i can collect  he left derbyshire only one day      after ourselves  and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them <EOS> <EOS> 231.74729279601033
<SOS> <SOS> the motive professed  was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well      known  as to make it impossible for any young woman of character       to love or confide in him <EOS> <EOS> 162.7662734064663
<SOS> <SOS> if he  had another  motive  i am sure it would never      disgrace him <EOS> <EOS> 123.88132856770348
<SOS> <SOS> younge  who was some time ago governess to missarcy  and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation  though      he did not say what <EOS> <EOS> 290.91986768295794
<SOS> <SOS> she then took a large house in edward street       and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings <EOS> <EOS> 435.3419330353327
<SOS> <SOS> this mr <EOS> <EOS> 309.30660629760985
<SOS> <SOS> younge was  he knew  intimately acquainted with wickham  and he      went to her for intelligence of him  as soon as he got to town <EOS> <EOS> 225.77033802940062
<SOS> <SOS> but      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted <EOS> <EOS> 199.90577420489717
<SOS> <SOS> she would not betray her trust  i suppose  without bribery      and corruption  for she really did know where her friend was to be      found <EOS> <EOS> 164.7585384681052
<SOS> <SOS> at length  however  our      kind friend procured the wished for direction <EOS> <EOS> 669.9339657809487
<SOS> <SOS> they were in           street <EOS> <EOS> 160.28061329769437
<SOS> <SOS> he saw wickham  and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia <EOS> <EOS> 222.89757224275417
<SOS> <SOS> his first object with her  he acknowledged  had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation  and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her       offering his assistance  as far as it would go <EOS> <EOS> 230.723797492585
<SOS> <SOS> but he found lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was <EOS> <EOS> 263.96044818581413
<SOS> <SOS> she was sure they should be married some time or      other  and it did not much signify when <EOS> <EOS> 150.83314476434944
<SOS> <SOS> he confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment  on account of some debts of honour       which were very pressing  and scrupled not to lay all the      ill consequences of lydia s flight  on her own folly alone <EOS> <EOS> 250.66783126524467
<SOS> <SOS> he      meant to resign his commission immediately  and as to his future      situation  he could conjecture very little about it <EOS> <EOS> 213.18117139687155
<SOS> <SOS> he must go      somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew he should have      nothing to live on <EOS> <EOS> 180.6253373091964
<SOS> <SOS> though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich       he would have been able to do something for him  and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage <EOS> <EOS> 101.28763932518017
<SOS> <SOS> but he found  in reply to      this question  that wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage  in some other country <EOS> <EOS> 268.28674855461185
<SOS> <SOS> under such circumstances  however  he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief <EOS> <EOS> 233.19739813415137
<SOS> <SOS> they met several times       for there was much to be discussed <EOS> <EOS> 269.51968042290576
<SOS> <SOS> wickham of course wanted more      than he could get  but at length was reduced to be reasonable <EOS> <EOS> 353.0593864119031
<SOS> <SOS> every thing being settled between  them   mr darcy s next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in      gracechurch street the evening before i came home <EOS> <EOS> 318.7255097243166
<SOS> <SOS> he did not      leave his name  and till the next day  it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business <EOS> <EOS> 178.77444627488057
<SOS> <SOS> on saturday he came again <EOS> <EOS> 235.04681796375283
<SOS> <SOS> your      father was gone  your uncle at home  and  as i said before  they      had a great deal of talk together <EOS> <EOS> 147.6626889527324
<SOS> <SOS> they met again on sunday  and      then  i  saw him too <EOS> <EOS> 217.2138203196603
<SOS> <SOS> it was not all settled before monday  as soon      as it was  the express was sent off to longbourn <EOS> <EOS> 162.53703424578708
<SOS> <SOS> but our visitor      was very obstinate <EOS> <EOS> 232.14911424706926
<SOS> <SOS> i fancy  lizzy  that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all <EOS> <EOS> 236.13259486292208
<SOS> <SOS> he has been accused of many      faults at different times  but  this  is the true one <EOS> <EOS> 261.22598253306944
<SOS> <SOS> they battled it      together for a long time  which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved <EOS> <EOS> 252.50352982405158
<SOS> <SOS> but at last your uncle was forced      to yield  and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece       was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it       which went sorely against the grain  and i really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure  because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers  and give      the praise where it was due <EOS> <EOS> 294.32831123570486
<SOS> <SOS> you know pretty well  i suppose       what has been done for the young people <EOS> <EOS> 178.87761922934212
<SOS> <SOS> his debts are to be paid       amounting  i believe  to considerably more than a thousand pounds       another thousand in addition to her own settled upon  her   and his      commission purchased <EOS> <EOS> 330.8135992725184
<SOS> <SOS> the reason why all this was to be done by him      alone  was such as i have given above <EOS> <EOS> 250.11332603871534
<SOS> <SOS> it was owing to him  to his      reserve  and want of proper consideration  that wickham s character      had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was <EOS> <EOS> 109.53215460665122
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps there was some truth in       this   though i doubt whether  his  reserve  or  anybody s       reserve  can be answerable for the event <EOS> <EOS> 348.55650478727364
<SOS> <SOS> but in spite of all this      fine talking  my dear lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured  that      your uncle would never have yielded  if we had not given him credit      for  another interest  in the affair <EOS> <EOS> 269.45709884040855
<SOS> <SOS> when all this was resolved      on  he returned again to his friends  who were still staying at      pemberley  but it was agreed that he should be in london once more      when the wedding took place  and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish <EOS> <EOS> 260.16752745560683
<SOS> <SOS> it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise  i      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure <EOS> <EOS> 190.6651095048159
<SOS> <SOS> i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner       representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done  and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family <EOS> <EOS> 129.72493919033664
<SOS> <SOS> if she heard me       it was by good luck  for i am sure she did not listen <EOS> <EOS> 117.75005384553768
<SOS> <SOS> i was      sometimes quite provoked  but then i recollected my dear elizabeth      and jane  and for their sakes had patience with her <EOS> <EOS> 212.93548279694846
<SOS> <SOS> he dined with us the next day  and was to leave town again      on wednesday or thursday <EOS> <EOS> 291.1856140482298
<SOS> <SOS> his behaviour to us has       in every respect  been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire <EOS> <EOS> 289.23903921845584
<SOS> <SOS> his understanding and opinions all please me  he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness  and  that   if he marry  prudently   his      wife may teach him <EOS> <EOS> 288.11320703479663
<SOS> <SOS> i thought him very sly   he hardly ever      mentioned your name <EOS> <EOS> 353.65457917306935
<SOS> <SOS> but slyness seems the fashion <EOS> <EOS> 398.5747734389696

<SOS> <SOS> a low phaeton  with a nice little      pair of ponies  would be the very thing <EOS> <EOS> 231.89320462626713

<SOS> <SOS> the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share <EOS> <EOS> 354.3219952158483
<SOS> <SOS> the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match  which she had feared to encourage  as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the pain of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true <EOS> <EOS> 213.97353163963123
<SOS> <SOS> he had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research  in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise  and where he was reduced to meet  frequently meet  reason with  persuade  and finally bribe  the man whom he always most wished to avoid  and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce <EOS> <EOS> 221.08690734435214
<SOS> <SOS> her heart did whisper  that he had done it for her <EOS> <EOS> 95.34532695916921
<SOS> <SOS> but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection for her  for a woman who had already refused him  as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham <EOS> <EOS> 324.4176655036037
<SOS> <SOS> brother in law of wickham <EOS> <EOS> 202.47712772490408
<SOS> <SOS> every kind of pride must revolt from the connection <EOS> <EOS> 191.82826829791705
<SOS> <SOS> she was ashamed to think how much <EOS> <EOS> 122.25948091771373
<SOS> <SOS> but he had given a reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief <EOS> <EOS> 247.4994925406419
<SOS> <SOS> it was painful  exceedingly painful  to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return <EOS> <EOS> 237.54684185198656
<SOS> <SOS> they owed the restoration of lydia  her character  every thing to him <EOS> <EOS> 192.10402663538582
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged  every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him <EOS> <EOS> 503.89902553857985
<SOS> <SOS> for herself she was humbled  but she was proud of him <EOS> <EOS> 100.28934299930764
<SOS> <SOS> proud that in a cause of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of himself <EOS> <EOS> 122.69619138455977
<SOS> <SOS> she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again <EOS> <EOS> 159.70718068999977
<SOS> <SOS> it was hardly enough  but it pleased her <EOS> <EOS> 139.56355706330604
<SOS> <SOS> she was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one s approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was overtaken by wickham <EOS> <EOS> 183.52551399406622
<SOS> <SOS> i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister <EOS> <EOS> 223.00865635790896
<SOS> <SOS> said he  as he joined her <EOS> <EOS> 83.88869430406787
<SOS> <SOS> you certainly do   she replied with a smile   but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome <EOS> <EOS> 195.10189838942463
<SOS> <SOS> i should be sorry indeed  if it were <EOS> <EOS> 111.9016802740478

<SOS> <SOS> poor reynolds  she was always very fond of me <EOS> <EOS> 190.46251548843637
<SOS> <SOS> but of course she did not mention my name to you <EOS> <EOS> 151.8206883947039
<SOS> <SOS> yes  she did <EOS> <EOS> 128.30943536223563
<SOS> <SOS> and what did she say <EOS> <EOS> 147.7824697895344
<SOS> <SOS> at such a distance as  that   you know  things are strangely misrepresented <EOS> <EOS> 232.81157517402914
<SOS> <SOS> certainly   he replied  biting his lips <EOS> <EOS> 223.9017826080523
<SOS> <SOS> we passed each other several times <EOS> <EOS> 765.6129362173896

<SOS> <SOS> undoubtedly <EOS> <EOS> 284.04650472440744
<SOS> <SOS> did you see him while you were at lambton <EOS> <EOS> 153.10818821875762
<SOS> <SOS> yes  he introduced us to his sister <EOS> <EOS> 144.97686880101602
<SOS> <SOS> and do you like her <EOS> <EOS> 108.28073415830619
<SOS> <SOS> i have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two <EOS> <EOS> 308.37003878238113
<SOS> <SOS> i am very glad you liked her <EOS> <EOS> 116.68258329514615
<SOS> <SOS> i dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age <EOS> <EOS> 325.74260428084875
<SOS> <SOS> did you go by the village of kympton <EOS> <EOS> 101.99307417393122

<SOS> <SOS> excellent parsonage house <EOS> <EOS> 635.1811161452753
<SOS> <SOS> it would have suited me in every respect <EOS> <EOS> 147.3840249267623
<SOS> <SOS> how should you have liked making sermons <EOS> <EOS> 584.1813407062485
<SOS> <SOS> exceedingly well <EOS> <EOS> 275.9409476949495
<SOS> <SOS> i should have considered it as part of my duty  and the exertion would soon have been nothing <EOS> <EOS> 192.384126788086
<SOS> <SOS> the quiet  the retirement of such a life  would have answered all my ideas of happiness <EOS> <EOS> 185.54947812647222
<SOS> <SOS> but it was not to be <EOS> <EOS> 36.98574065556843
<SOS> <SOS> did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance  when you were in kent <EOS> <EOS> 274.9601308403991
<SOS> <SOS> i  have  heard from authority  which i thought  as good   that it was left you conditionally only  and at the will of the present patron <EOS> <EOS> 159.41747852264444
<SOS> <SOS> yes  there was something in  that   i told you so from the first  you may remember <EOS> <EOS> 160.01212322650485
<SOS> <SOS> i  did  hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders  and that the business had been compromised accordingly <EOS> <EOS> 218.2875092131845
<SOS> <SOS> you may remember what i told you on that point  when first we talked of it <EOS> <EOS> 242.0948492487923
<SOS> <SOS> they were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked fast to get rid of him  and unwilling for her sister s sake  to provoke him  she only said in reply  with a good humoured smile   come  mr wickham  we are brother and sister  you know <EOS> <EOS> 182.66215801588658
<SOS> <SOS> in future  i hope we shall be always of one mind <EOS> <EOS> 244.68904644028552
<SOS> <SOS> she held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry  though he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house <EOS> <EOS> 329.86485585843974
<SOS> <SOS> chapter xi <EOS> <EOS> 369.4567036044155

<SOS> <SOS> he smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things <EOS> <EOS> 549.5905202384362
<SOS> <SOS> he is as fine a fellow   said mr bennet  as soon as they were out of the house   as ever i saw <EOS> <EOS> 123.4660649049104
<SOS> <SOS> he simpers  and smirks  and makes love to us all <EOS> <EOS> 146.37598752423412
<SOS> <SOS> i am prodigiously proud of him <EOS> <EOS> 152.2984917471701
<SOS> <SOS> i defy even sir william lucas himself  to produce a more valuable son in law <EOS> <EOS> 594.175664943333
<SOS> <SOS> bennet very dull for several days <EOS> <EOS> 613.3746802594759
<SOS> <SOS> this is the consequence you see  madam  of marrying a daughter   said elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 285.3027163253594
<SOS> <SOS> it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single <EOS> <EOS> 260.84316353301637
<SOS> <SOS> if that had been nearer  she would not have gone so soon <EOS> <EOS> 145.18866280257268
<SOS> <SOS> the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master  who was coming down in a day or two  to shoot there for several weeks <EOS> <EOS> 261.3389811762055
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> she looked at jane  and smiled  and shook her head by turns <EOS> <EOS> 230.40445822231646
<SOS> <SOS> philips first brought her the news <EOS> <EOS> 439.05411278236505
<SOS> <SOS> well  so much the better <EOS> <EOS> 165.2392948816793
<SOS> <SOS> not that i care about it  though <EOS> <EOS> 219.51032610622823
<SOS> <SOS> he is nothing to us  you know  and i am sure  i  never want to see him again <EOS> <EOS> 71.92314002385727
<SOS> <SOS> but  however  he is very welcome to come to netherfield  if he likes it <EOS> <EOS> 126.85780643212713
<SOS> <SOS> and who knows what  may  happen <EOS> <EOS> 263.96465844210854
<SOS> <SOS> but that is nothing to us <EOS> <EOS> 134.54192085463788
<SOS> <SOS> and so  is it quite certain he is coming <EOS> <EOS> 296.6427683326181
<SOS> <SOS> you may depend on it   replied the other   for mr <EOS> <EOS> 199.73933282587086
<SOS> <SOS> nicholls was in meryton last night  i saw her passing by  and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was certain true <EOS> <EOS> 223.32571045124698
<SOS> <SOS> she was going to the butcher s  she told me  on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday  and she has got three couple of ducks  just fit to be killed <EOS> <EOS> 237.1658249468607
<SOS> <SOS> missennet had not been able to hear of his coming  without changing colour <EOS> <EOS> 218.45607752579303
<SOS> <SOS> it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together  she said   i saw you look at me to day  lizzy  when my aunt told us of the present report  and i know i appeared distressed <EOS> <EOS> 217.48673232895277
<SOS> <SOS> but don t imagine it was from any silly cause <EOS> <EOS> 440.2504874394615
<SOS> <SOS> i was only confused for the moment  because i felt that i  should  be looked at <EOS> <EOS> 118.51671739046064
<SOS> <SOS> i do assure you  that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain <EOS> <EOS> 284.53742850072587
<SOS> <SOS> i am glad of one thing  that he comes alone  because we shall see the less of him <EOS> <EOS> 212.56415718130617
<SOS> <SOS> not that i am afraid of  myself   but i dread other people s remarks <EOS> <EOS> 203.93794994496966
<SOS> <SOS> had she not seen him in derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming there  with no other view than what was acknowledged  but she still thought him partial to jane  and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there  with  his friend s permission  or being bold enough to come without it <EOS> <EOS> 224.89817212984926
<SOS> <SOS> i  will  leave him to himself <EOS> <EOS> 131.7246423872406
<SOS> <SOS> they were more disturbed  more unequal  than she had often seen them <EOS> <EOS> 234.20536985391058
<SOS> <SOS> the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents  about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again <EOS> <EOS> 386.3456641745052
<SOS> <SOS> as soon as ever mr bingley comes  my dear   said mr <EOS> <EOS> 182.83832952850122
<SOS> <SOS> bennet   you will wait on him of course <EOS> <EOS> 225.68806659137985
<SOS> <SOS> no  no <EOS> <EOS> 105.64624570863654
<SOS> <SOS> but it ended in nothing  and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again <EOS> <EOS> 114.0489080501733
<SOS> <SOS> his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his returning to netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 311.84309187336856
<SOS> <SOS> tis an etiquette i despise   said he <EOS> <EOS> 381.33397325432776
<SOS> <SOS> if he wants our society  let him seek it <EOS> <EOS> 485.7825803574042
<SOS> <SOS> he knows where we live <EOS> <EOS> 425.9236006534438
<SOS> <SOS> i will not spend  my  hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away  and come back again <EOS> <EOS> 340.73489316889743
<SOS> <SOS> well  all i know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him <EOS> <EOS> 125.91487208491199
<SOS> <SOS> but  however  that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here  i am determined <EOS> <EOS> 443.62999128694395
<SOS> <SOS> we must have mr <EOS> <EOS> 213.2546048247801
<SOS> <SOS> that will make thirteen with ourselves  so there will be just room at table for him <EOS> <EOS> 203.413857859285
<SOS> <SOS> consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it  before  they  did <EOS> <EOS> 174.94061321192171
<SOS> <SOS> as the day of his arrival drew near   i begin to be sorry that he comes at all   said jane to her sister <EOS> <EOS> 144.58622198299383
<SOS> <SOS> it would be nothing  i could see him with perfect indifference  but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of <EOS> <EOS> 235.8921058762605
<SOS> <SOS> you must feel it  and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me  because you have always so much <EOS> <EOS> 215.7246798673443
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  through the assistance of servants  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side  might be as long as it could <EOS> <EOS> 185.88783099202058
<SOS> <SOS> she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent  hopeless of seeing him before <EOS> <EOS> 207.63308978104703
<SOS> <SOS> her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy <EOS> <EOS> 262.63404845858406
<SOS> <SOS> jane resolutely kept her place at the table  but elizabeth  to satisfy her mother  went to the window  she looked   she saw mr darcy with him  and sat down again by her sister <EOS> <EOS> 175.88745993980206
<SOS> <SOS> replied kitty   it looks just like that man that used to be with him before <EOS> <EOS> 333.4634644321541
<SOS> <SOS> mr what s his name <EOS> <EOS> 223.069709100463
<SOS> <SOS> that tall  proud man <EOS> <EOS> 539.5408798695686
<SOS> <SOS> good gracious <EOS> <EOS> 328.6480039351516
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 55.109369249021235
<SOS> <SOS> and so it does i vow <EOS> <EOS> 148.35527081220587
<SOS> <SOS> well  any friend of mr bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure  but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him <EOS> <EOS> 143.03112474882653
<SOS> <SOS> she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire  and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter <EOS> <EOS> 208.43999667931553
<SOS> <SOS> both sisters were uncomfortable enough <EOS> <EOS> 478.9415125694723
<SOS> <SOS> each felt for the other  and of course for themselves  and their mother talked on  of her dislike of mr darcy  and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley s friend  without being heard by either of them <EOS> <EOS> 133.20408227313905
<SOS> <SOS> but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mr <EOS> <EOS> 182.02724956848306
<SOS> <SOS> to jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused  and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own more extensive information  he was the person  to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits  and whom she regarded herself with an interest  if not quite so tender  at least as reasonable and just  as what jane felt for bingley <EOS> <EOS> 204.5394702358319
<SOS> <SOS> but she would not be secure <EOS> <EOS> 76.00716722919394
<SOS> <SOS> let me first see how he behaves   said she   it will then be early enough for expectation <EOS> <EOS> 353.30498488703364
<SOS> <SOS> jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than elizabeth had expected <EOS> <EOS> 246.64284998437319
<SOS> <SOS> on the gentlemen s appearing  her colour increased  yet she received them with tolerable ease  and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment  or any unnecessary complaisance <EOS> <EOS> 450.89346045919046
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and sat down again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not often command <EOS> <EOS> 289.14371400807096
<SOS> <SOS> she had ventured only one glance at darcy <EOS> <EOS> 299.8249816032592
<SOS> <SOS> he looked serious as usual  and she thought  more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  than as she had seen him at pemberley <EOS> <EOS> 140.47640162472445
<SOS> <SOS> but  perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt <EOS> <EOS> 113.31153076354553
<SOS> <SOS> he was received by mr <EOS> <EOS> 170.93436363675562
<SOS> <SOS> bennet with a degree of civility  which made her two daughters ashamed  especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend <EOS> <EOS> 260.2504128999937
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy  was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied <EOS> <EOS> 303.1992833333517
<SOS> <SOS> darcy  after enquiring of her how mr and mr <EOS> <EOS> 353.86808919224114
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner did  a question which she could not answer without confusion  said scarcely any thing <EOS> <EOS> 250.18111104327343
<SOS> <SOS> he was not seated by her  perhaps that was the reason of his silence  but it had not been so in derbyshire <EOS> <EOS> 85.7008483008241
<SOS> <SOS> there he had talked to her friends  when he could not to herself <EOS> <EOS> 105.76497564400502
<SOS> <SOS> but now several minutes elapsed  without bringing the sound of his voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist the impulse of curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often found him looking at jane  as at herself  and frequently on no object but the ground <EOS> <EOS> 314.29372841210164
<SOS> <SOS> more thoughtfulness  and less anxiety to please than when they last met  were plainly expressed <EOS> <EOS> 541.3333343596181
<SOS> <SOS> she was disappointed  and angry with herself for being so <EOS> <EOS> 168.29401650056542
<SOS> <SOS> could i expect it to be otherwise <EOS> <EOS> 146.0118480266061
<SOS> <SOS> said she <EOS> <EOS> 99.4091061240576
<SOS> <SOS> yet why did he come <EOS> <EOS> 359.9560749937569
<SOS> <SOS> she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself  and to him she had hardly courage to speak <EOS> <EOS> 140.10268686208425

<SOS> <SOS> bennet <EOS> <EOS> 221.34761884565685
<SOS> <SOS> he readily agreed to it <EOS> <EOS> 185.693116073854
<SOS> <SOS> i began to be afraid you would never come back again <EOS> <EOS> 179.22833469308569
<SOS> <SOS> people  did  say  you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas  but  however  i hope it is not true <EOS> <EOS> 298.13983755416535

<SOS> <SOS> it was in the times and the courier  i know  though it was not put in as it ought to be <EOS> <EOS> 69.76072436207593
<SOS> <SOS> it was only said   lately  george wickham  esq <EOS> <EOS> 241.37421773041245
<SOS> <SOS> did you see it <EOS> <EOS> 116.48182154358703
<SOS> <SOS> bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations <EOS> <EOS> 197.6949835945959
<SOS> <SOS> how mr darcy looked  therefore  she could not tell <EOS> <EOS> 134.75678013160436
<SOS> <SOS> it is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well married   continued her mother   but at the same time  mr bingley  it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me <EOS> <EOS> 116.01559329461351
<SOS> <SOS> they are gone down to newcastle  a place quite northward  it seems  and there they are to stay  i do not know how long <EOS> <EOS> 297.35690463143294
<SOS> <SOS> thank heaven <EOS> <EOS> 484.02683545850044
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy  was in such misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat <EOS> <EOS> 121.7247329017904
<SOS> <SOS> it drew from her  however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else had so effectually done before  and she asked bingley  whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present <EOS> <EOS> 261.44319675384014
<SOS> <SOS> a few weeks  he believed <EOS> <EOS> 264.4382148292261
<SOS> <SOS> when you have killed all your own birds  mr bingley   said her mother   i beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you please  on mr bennet s manor <EOS> <EOS> 180.52649838738583
<SOS> <SOS> i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you  and will save all the best of the covies for you <EOS> <EOS> 76.98004834757596
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious attention <EOS> <EOS> 543.1228603934602
<SOS> <SOS> at that instant she felt  that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends  for moments of such painful confusion <EOS> <EOS> 367.4882582526669
<SOS> <SOS> the first wish of my heart   said she to herself   is never more to be in company with either of them <EOS> <EOS> 131.43227465470548
<SOS> <SOS> their society can afford no pleasure  that will atone for such wretchedness as this <EOS> <EOS> 375.4060344479683
<SOS> <SOS> let me never see either one or the other again <EOS> <EOS> 302.31861234739654
<SOS> <SOS> he found her as handsome as she had been last year  as good natured  and as unaffected  though not quite so chatty <EOS> <EOS> 198.20621697963847
<SOS> <SOS> but her mind was so busily engaged  that she did not always know when she was silent <EOS> <EOS> 138.2717833619861
<SOS> <SOS> when the gentlemen rose to go away  mr <EOS> <EOS> 325.4143546578782
<SOS> <SOS> bennet was mindful of her intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time <EOS> <EOS> 184.09241877081791
<SOS> <SOS> you are quite a visit in my debt  mr bingley   she added   for when you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family dinner with us  as soon as you returned <EOS> <EOS> 237.96524934579358
<SOS> <SOS> i have not forgot  you see  and i assure you  i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement <EOS> <EOS> 139.81626407345883
<SOS> <SOS> bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said something of his concern  at having been prevented by business <EOS> <EOS> 301.64566774875783
<SOS> <SOS> they then went away <EOS> <EOS> 274.77872604816196
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there  that day  but  though she always kept a very good table  she did not think any thing less than two courses  could be good enough for a man  on whom she had such anxious designs  or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year <EOS> <EOS> 295.5032588115222
<SOS> <SOS> as soon as they were gone  elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits  or in other words  to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more <EOS> <EOS> 266.0120311845979
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her <EOS> <EOS> 136.4312272796152
<SOS> <SOS> why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent   said she   did he come at all <EOS> <EOS> 196.6756241071732
<SOS> <SOS> she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure <EOS> <EOS> 191.59547364530732
<SOS> <SOS> he could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt  when he was in town  and why not to me <EOS> <EOS> 161.09811416112376
<SOS> <SOS> if he fears me  why come hither <EOS> <EOS> 541.5678974020285

<SOS> <SOS> i will think no more about him <EOS> <EOS> 122.91031007390767
<SOS> <SOS> her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look  which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors  than elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 273.674595012048
<SOS> <SOS> now   said she   that this first meeting is over  i feel perfectly easy <EOS> <EOS> 481.2198803704063
<SOS> <SOS> i know my own strength  and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming <EOS> <EOS> 119.47776437113525
<SOS> <SOS> i am glad he dines here on tuesday <EOS> <EOS> 222.33134284506528
<SOS> <SOS> yes  very indifferent indeed   said elizabeth  laughingly <EOS> <EOS> 433.91645026518637
<SOS> <SOS> oh  jane  take care <EOS> <EOS> 506.36305594790946
<SOS> <SOS> my dear lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger now <EOS> <EOS> 137.46895098991237
<SOS> <SOS> i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever <EOS> <EOS> 109.06212606573504
<SOS> <SOS> they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  and mr <EOS> <EOS> 257.6847408834567
<SOS> <SOS> on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  and the two  who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen  were in very good time <EOS> <EOS> 209.5029183632065
<SOS> <SOS> when they repaired to the dining room  elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place  which  in all their former parties  had belonged to him  by her sister <EOS> <EOS> 220.3199492921426
<SOS> <SOS> her prudent mother  occupied by the same ideas  forbore to invite him to sit by herself <EOS> <EOS> 250.12043553042398
<SOS> <SOS> on entering the room  he seemed to hesitate  but jane happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was decided <EOS> <EOS> 308.21257644347315
<SOS> <SOS> he placed himself by her <EOS> <EOS> 127.93691029904797
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his friend <EOS> <EOS> 316.83420805613366
<SOS> <SOS> he bore it with noble indifference  and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy  with an expression of half laughing alarm <EOS> <EOS> 236.10787736216275
<SOS> <SOS> his behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as shewed an admiration of her  which  though more guarded than formerly  persuaded elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself  jane s happiness  and his own  would be speedily secured <EOS> <EOS> 367.28674258840465
<SOS> <SOS> it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in no cheerful humour <EOS> <EOS> 198.54937050088108
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy was almost as far from her  as the table could divide them <EOS> <EOS> 174.3175238834139
<SOS> <SOS> he was on one side of her mother <EOS> <EOS> 98.97770745916655
<SOS> <SOS> she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either  or make either appear to advantage <EOS> <EOS> 439.46776728445315
<SOS> <SOS> she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse  but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other  and how formal and cold was their manner  whenever they did <EOS> <EOS> 284.0639711219959
<SOS> <SOS> her mother s ungraciousness  made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind  and she would  at times  have given any thing to be privileged to tell him  that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family <EOS> <EOS> 174.86132643179445
<SOS> <SOS> she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation  than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance <EOS> <EOS> 306.45066273092044
<SOS> <SOS> anxious and uneasy  the period which passed in the drawing room  before the gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull to a degree  that almost made her uncivil <EOS> <EOS> 238.99847356016633
<SOS> <SOS> if he does not come to me   then    said she   i shall give him up for ever <EOS> <EOS> 125.42372923504364
<SOS> <SOS> the gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes  but  alas <EOS> <EOS> 160.15938829661914
<SOS> <SOS> the ladies had crowded round the table  where missennet was making tea  and elizabeth pouring out the coffee  in so close a confederacy  that there was not a single vacancy near her  which would admit of a chair <EOS> <EOS> 253.68011029924844
<SOS> <SOS> she followed him with her eyes  envied every one to whom he spoke  had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged against herself for being so silly <EOS> <EOS> 316.27277050299796
<SOS> <SOS> a man who has once been refused <EOS> <EOS> 268.35770498706864
<SOS> <SOS> how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love <EOS> <EOS> 178.51939495463017
<SOS> <SOS> is there one among the sex  who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman <EOS> <EOS> 229.87514905076662
<SOS> <SOS> she was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his coffee cup himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying   is your sister at pemberley still <EOS> <EOS> 206.51249682646343
<SOS> <SOS> and quite alone <EOS> <EOS> 224.64250008955443
<SOS> <SOS> have all her friends left her <EOS> <EOS> 182.72072403672928

<SOS> <SOS> the others have been gone on to scarborough  these three weeks <EOS> <EOS> 273.02826354367375
<SOS> <SOS> she could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to converse with her  he might have better success <EOS> <EOS> 173.64478919106793
<SOS> <SOS> when the tea things were removed  and the card tables placed  the ladies all rose  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him  when all her views were overthrown  by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players  and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party <EOS> <EOS> 233.14322635683777
<SOS> <SOS> she now lost every expectation of pleasure <EOS> <EOS> 295.8508606004845
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them <EOS> <EOS> 275.66366009868057
<SOS> <SOS> well girls   said she  as soon as they were left to themselves   what say you to the day <EOS> <EOS> 158.96250121129842
<SOS> <SOS> i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well  i assure you <EOS> <EOS> 281.5997361797594
<SOS> <SOS> the venison was roasted to a turn  and everybody said  they never saw so fat a haunch <EOS> <EOS> 81.93453583940484
<SOS> <SOS> the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week  and even mr darcy acknowledged  that the partridges were remarkably well done  and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least <EOS> <EOS> 236.15772188318914
<SOS> <SOS> and  my dear jane  i never saw you look in greater beauty <EOS> <EOS> 199.60493004853714
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> long said so too  for i asked her whether you did not <EOS> <EOS> 208.64740922208296
<SOS> <SOS> and what do you think she said besides <EOS> <EOS> 164.11246302940222
<SOS> <SOS> ah <EOS> <EOS> 279.94843002238997
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  we shall have her at netherfield at last <EOS> <EOS> 242.93915019542462

<SOS> <SOS> i do think mr <EOS> <EOS> 137.69123909683032
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane  to be convinced that she would get him at last  and her expectations of advantage to her family  when in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day  to make his proposals <EOS> <EOS> 190.60453386104538
<SOS> <SOS> it has been a very agreeable day   said missennet to elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 136.69903097319457
<SOS> <SOS> the party seemed so well selected  so suitable one with the other <EOS> <EOS> 253.13635534076275

<SOS> <SOS> i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish beyond it <EOS> <EOS> 247.51857814413785
<SOS> <SOS> i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are  that he never had any design of engaging my affection <EOS> <EOS> 200.38299056356846
<SOS> <SOS> it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address  and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man <EOS> <EOS> 253.2348762773668
<SOS> <SOS> how hard it is in some cases to be believed <EOS> <EOS> 188.61766516059342
<SOS> <SOS> but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge <EOS> <EOS> 238.40113956321798
<SOS> <SOS> that is a question which i hardly know how to answer <EOS> <EOS> 154.69287180818745

<SOS> <SOS> where is your sash my dear <EOS> <EOS> 111.07069686996711
<SOS> <SOS> the same anxiety to get them by themselves  was visible again in the evening <EOS> <EOS> 208.52602150637767
<SOS> <SOS> after tea  mr bennet retired to the library  as was his custom  and mary went up stairs to her instrument <EOS> <EOS> 290.40495366551124
<SOS> <SOS> two obstacles of the five being thus removed  mr <EOS> <EOS> 468.6314212351548
<SOS> <SOS> bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time  without making any impression on them <EOS> <EOS> 340.5135572064574
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth would not observe her  and when at last kitty did  she very innocently said   what is the matter mamma <EOS> <EOS> 205.35431711270851
<SOS> <SOS> what do you keep winking at me for <EOS> <EOS> 210.4992519038539

<SOS> <SOS> i did not wink at you <EOS> <EOS> 104.4479927009593
<SOS> <SOS> jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth  which spoke her distress at such premeditation  and her intreaty that  she  would not give into it <EOS> <EOS> 185.29162946607917
<SOS> <SOS> in a few minutes  mr <EOS> <EOS> 261.8475474262687

<SOS> <SOS> kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room <EOS> <EOS> 185.091526001329
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained quietly in the hall  till she and kitty were out of sight  then returned into the drawing room <EOS> <EOS> 273.3664893616071

<SOS> <SOS> bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual <EOS> <EOS> 175.87328842436054
<SOS> <SOS> bingley was every thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her daughter <EOS> <EOS> 214.5134940349089
<SOS> <SOS> his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party  and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance  particularly grateful to the daughter <EOS> <EOS> 278.3651861927836
<SOS> <SOS> not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley  but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded  unless mr darcy returned within the stated time <EOS> <EOS> 442.1337493775667
<SOS> <SOS> seriously  however  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence <EOS> <EOS> 372.45025083567435
<SOS> <SOS> bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and mr bennet spent the morning together  as had been agreed on <EOS> <EOS> 139.48291178376257
<SOS> <SOS> there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley  that could provoke his ridicule  or disgust him into silence  and he was more communicative  and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him <EOS> <EOS> 228.58123346618666
<SOS> <SOS> bingley of course returned with him to dinner  and in the evening mr <EOS> <EOS> 212.93095210835654
<SOS> <SOS> bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter <EOS> <EOS> 185.03375222113283
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  who had a letter to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea  for as the others were all going to sit down to cards  she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes <EOS> <EOS> 191.4448774380695
<SOS> <SOS> but on returning to the drawing room  when her letter was finished  she saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her <EOS> <EOS> 139.1032693644948
<SOS> <SOS> on opening the door  she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth  as if engaged in earnest conversation  and had this led to no suspicion  the faces of both as they hastily turned round  and moved away from each other  would have told it all <EOS> <EOS> 343.756682524418
<SOS> <SOS> their  situation was awkward enough  but  her s  she thought was still worse <EOS> <EOS> 327.9323465520007
<SOS> <SOS> not a syllable was uttered by either  and elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when bingley  who as well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering a few words to her sister  ran out of the room <EOS> <EOS> 222.40998169053609
<SOS> <SOS> i do not deserve it <EOS> <EOS> 92.97999068936137

<SOS> <SOS> why is not every body as happy <EOS> <EOS> 290.14925441966346
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a warmth  a delight  which words could but poorly express <EOS> <EOS> 495.30019950289295
<SOS> <SOS> every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane <EOS> <EOS> 258.1481419349231
<SOS> <SOS> but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half that remained to be said  for the present <EOS> <EOS> 104.8880324981902
<SOS> <SOS> i must go instantly to my mother   she cried <EOS> <EOS> 242.7961402896005

<SOS> <SOS> she then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up the card party  and was sitting up stairs with kitty <EOS> <EOS> 337.6032303015767
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled  that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation <EOS> <EOS> 315.3334753775124
<SOS> <SOS> and this   said she   is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection <EOS> <EOS> 103.44769883554892
<SOS> <SOS> the happiest  wisest  most reasonable end <EOS> <EOS> 548.2738445710462
<SOS> <SOS> where is your sister <EOS> <EOS> 153.82262593725585
<SOS> <SOS> said he hastily  as he opened the door <EOS> <EOS> 176.04000650864154
<SOS> <SOS> he then shut the door  and coming up to her  claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister <EOS> <EOS> 203.77665439263103
<SOS> <SOS> they shook hands with great cordiality  and then till her sister came down  she had to listen to all he had to say  of his own happiness  and of jane s perfections  and in spite of his being a lover  elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity  to be rationally founded  because they had for basis the excellent understanding  and super excellent disposition of jane  and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself <EOS> <EOS> 205.83384039323417
<SOS> <SOS> kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped her turn was coming soon <EOS> <EOS> 263.82544093119384
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822
<SOS> <SOS> bennet could not give her consent  or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  though she talked to bingley of nothing else  for half an hour  and when mr bennet joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was <EOS> <EOS> 362.09542006427347
<SOS> <SOS> not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till their visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was gone  he turned to his daughter and said   jane  i congratulate you <EOS> <EOS> 220.22889267627863
<SOS> <SOS> you will be a very happy woman <EOS> <EOS> 98.16993696847815

<SOS> <SOS> my dear mr bennet   cried his wife   what are you talking of <EOS> <EOS> 159.32083360044422

<SOS> <SOS> jane was beyond competition her favourite child <EOS> <EOS> 434.7491197270278
<SOS> <SOS> her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense <EOS> <EOS> 247.35441148810423
<SOS> <SOS> mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter <EOS> <EOS> 287.6691435082795
<SOS> <SOS> bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at longbourn  coming frequently before breakfast  and always remaining till after supper  unless when some barbarous neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an invitation to dinner  which he thought himself obliged to accept <EOS> <EOS> 426.9259801927344
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister  for while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow on any one else  but she found herself considerably useful to both of them  in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur <EOS> <EOS> 262.06830472054276
<SOS> <SOS> in the absence of jane  he always attached himself to elizabeth  for the pleasure of talking of her  and when bingley was gone  jane constantly sought the same means of relief <EOS> <EOS> 187.49406458927464
<SOS> <SOS> he has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me  that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring <EOS> <EOS> 272.14264251608154
<SOS> <SOS> i had not believed it possible <EOS> <EOS> 147.96893649763715
<SOS> <SOS> but how did he account for it <EOS> <EOS> 164.52949819124376
<SOS> <SOS> it must have been his sister s doing <EOS> <EOS> 94.17792051115589
<SOS> <SOS> they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at  since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects <EOS> <EOS> 244.85297952050172
<SOS> <SOS> that is the most unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i ever heard you utter <EOS> <EOS> 243.67817280753331
<SOS> <SOS> good girl <EOS> <EOS> 357.8564044217623

<SOS> <SOS> would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last november  he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being indifferent  would have prevented his coming down again <EOS> <EOS> 262.4688902387191
<SOS> <SOS> he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of his modesty <EOS> <EOS> 76.78517143442753
<SOS> <SOS> this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good qualities <EOS> <EOS> 274.1894953174148
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was pleased to find  that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend  for  though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him <EOS> <EOS> 119.74001008977356
<SOS> <SOS> i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed <EOS> <EOS> 262.1613817384403

<SOS> <SOS> one morning  about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window  by the sound of a carriage  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn <EOS> <EOS> 234.05418150919178
<SOS> <SOS> it was too early in the morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours <EOS> <EOS> 164.0894703737926
<SOS> <SOS> the horses were post  and neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded it  were familiar to them <EOS> <EOS> 164.7548919510099

<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother  on her ladyship s entrance  though no request of introduction had been made <EOS> <EOS> 176.84307312620376

<SOS> <SOS> this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening  in summer  the windows are full west <EOS> <EOS> 237.75986598448193
<SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> <EOS> 248.42386806158822

<SOS> <SOS> bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take some refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not very politely  declined eating any thing  and then rising up  said to elizabeth   missennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn <EOS> <EOS> 331.15089163607576
<SOS> <SOS> go  my dear   cried her mother   and shew her ladyship about the different walks <EOS> <EOS> 226.55370323606147

<SOS> <SOS> they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman  who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable <EOS> <EOS> 348.3229317635847

<SOS> <SOS> i send no compliments to your mother <EOS> <EOS> 162.77465512968513

<SOS> <SOS> i am most seriously displeased <EOS> <EOS> 246.08631194491682
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it herself <EOS> <EOS> 316.9725278999243
<SOS> <SOS> her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room  to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself <EOS> <EOS> 233.94990197493237
<SOS> <SOS> she did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go <EOS> <EOS> 136.50605779944289
<SOS> <SOS> she is a very fine looking woman <EOS> <EOS> 146.08489857412755
<SOS> <SOS> and her calling here was prodigiously civil <EOS> <EOS> 319.1468753489385
<SOS> <SOS> for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the collinses were well <EOS> <EOS> 218.850296505925
<SOS> <SOS> the discomposure of spirits  which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she for many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly <EOS> <EOS> 544.2553232496173
<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 326.136128044493
<SOS> <SOS> it was a rational scheme to be sure <EOS> <EOS> 116.6751367077401
<SOS> <SOS> but from what the report of their engagement could originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  till she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of bingley  and  her  being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the expectation of one wedding  made every body eager for another  to supply the idea <EOS> <EOS> 206.71222040011298
<SOS> <SOS> and her neighbours at lucas lodge  therefore   for through their communication with the collinses  the report she concluded had reached lady catherine  had only set  that  down  as almost certain and immediate  which  she  had looked forward to as possible  at some future time <EOS> <EOS> 399.56545339043447
<SOS> <SOS> in revolving lady catherine s expressions  however  she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference <EOS> <EOS> 158.05009775780664
<SOS> <SOS> from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew  and how  he  might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce <EOS> <EOS> 241.24330321975134
<SOS> <SOS> she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it was certain  that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one   whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  his aunt would address him on his weakest side <EOS> <EOS> 171.92944425213827
<SOS> <SOS> with his notions of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good sense and solid reasoning <EOS> <EOS> 317.71831740090846
<SOS> <SOS> if he had been wavering before  as to what he should do  which had often seemed likely  the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to be as happy  as dignity unblemished could make him <EOS> <EOS> 247.63011980551232
<SOS> <SOS> in that case he would return no more <EOS> <EOS> 160.48994537190703
<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine might see him in her way through town  and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way <EOS> <EOS> 272.95833297484427
<SOS> <SOS> if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise  should come to his friend within a few days   she added   i shall know how to understand it <EOS> <EOS> 323.50536227931536
<SOS> <SOS> i shall then give over every expectation  every wish of his constancy <EOS> <EOS> 202.3289905404406
<SOS> <SOS> if he is satisfied with only regretting me  when he might have obtained my affections and hand  i shall soon cease to regret him at all <EOS> <EOS> 243.675322823784
<SOS> <SOS> the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their visitor had been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied it  with the same kind of supposition  which had appeased mr <EOS> <EOS> 176.56831819993505
<SOS> <SOS> the next morning  as she was going down stairs  she was met by her father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand <EOS> <EOS> 142.92446070629146
<SOS> <SOS> lizzy   said he   i was going to look for you  come into my room <EOS> <EOS> 172.51162534032872
<SOS> <SOS> she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her  was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held <EOS> <EOS> 167.72987562011284
<SOS> <SOS> it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations <EOS> <EOS> 145.29074929056515
<SOS> <SOS> she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat down <EOS> <EOS> 234.34651175234507
<SOS> <SOS> as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to know its contents <EOS> <EOS> 438.06443591915314
<SOS> <SOS> let me congratulate you  on a very important conquest <EOS> <EOS> 282.0762581654436
<SOS> <SOS> the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  instead of the aunt  and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself  when her father continued   you look conscious <EOS> <EOS> 193.68244423670237
<SOS> <SOS> young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these  but i think i may defy even  your  sagacity  to discover the name of your admirer <EOS> <EOS> 253.16162100059958
<SOS> <SOS> this letter is from mr collins <EOS> <EOS> 125.7772513445006
<SOS> <SOS> something very much to the purpose of course <EOS> <EOS> 192.1149066295097
<SOS> <SOS> he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter  of which it seems he has been told  by some of the good natured  gossiping lucases <EOS> <EOS> 255.88526445259825
<SOS> <SOS> i shall not sport with your impatience  by reading what he says on that point <EOS> <EOS> 232.5006790134317
<SOS> <SOS> collins and myself on this happy event  let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  of which we have been advertised by the same authority <EOS> <EOS> 233.7468493372913
<SOS> <SOS> your daughter elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet  after her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of her fate  may be reasonably looked up to  as one of the most illustrious personages in this land <EOS> <EOS> 180.89246416682403
<SOS> <SOS> can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this <EOS> <EOS> 379.63940804522673
<SOS> <SOS> this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way  with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire   splendid property  noble kindred  and extensive patronage <EOS> <EOS> 535.3207906903154
<SOS> <SOS> have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is <EOS> <EOS> 482.4930881392136
<SOS> <SOS> but now it comes out <EOS> <EOS> 260.6986635491598
<SOS> <SOS> we have reason to imagine that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on the match with a friendly eye <EOS> <EOS> 333.50820816474004
<SOS> <SOS> mr darcy   you see  is the man <EOS> <EOS> 90.6284599900682
<SOS> <SOS> could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man  within the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related <EOS> <EOS> 295.5475432009805
<SOS> <SOS> never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her <EOS> <EOS> 193.04449840644793
<SOS> <SOS> are you not diverted <EOS> <EOS> 239.84748393302615
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> pray read on <EOS> <EOS> 339.30443997441523
<SOS> <SOS> after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night  she immediately  with her usual condescension  expressed what she felt on the occasion  when it became apparent  that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin  she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match <EOS> <EOS> 227.84707234051137
<SOS> <SOS> i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned <EOS> <EOS> 217.35170092233218
<SOS> <SOS> you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing <EOS> <EOS> 289.6763486211006
<SOS> <SOS> the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation  and his expectation of a young olive branch <EOS> <EOS> 174.54267966723728
<SOS> <SOS> but  lizzy  you look as if you did not enjoy it <EOS> <EOS> 158.52629145523662
<SOS> <SOS> you are not going to be  misssh   i hope  and pretend to be affronted at an idle report <EOS> <EOS> 135.3681826587503
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> cried elizabeth   i am excessively diverted <EOS> <EOS> 274.0413896005693
<SOS> <SOS> but it is so strange <EOS> <EOS> 117.55055058994331
<SOS> <SOS> had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference  and  your  pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd <EOS> <EOS> 300.5134330735101
<SOS> <SOS> much as i abominate writing  i would not give up mr collins s correspondence for any consideration <EOS> <EOS> 201.97961842299904
<SOS> <SOS> nay  when i read a letter of his  i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham  much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law <EOS> <EOS> 266.3589189583469
<SOS> <SOS> to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not distressed by his repeating it <EOS> <EOS> 154.80163368495255
<SOS> <SOS> her father had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of mr darcy s indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too  little   she might have fancied too  much <EOS> <EOS> 227.7902282489317
<SOS> <SOS> instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do  he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit <EOS> <EOS> 250.18847798666317
<SOS> <SOS> the gentlemen arrived early  and  before mr <EOS> <EOS> 404.54215468858575
<SOS> <SOS> bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  bingley  who wanted to be alone with jane  proposed their all walking out <EOS> <EOS> 335.42331820825433
<SOS> <SOS> bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip them <EOS> <EOS> 148.6519436479699
<SOS> <SOS> they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy  were to entertain each other <EOS> <EOS> 512.4597236048429
<SOS> <SOS> very little was said by either  kitty was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the same <EOS> <EOS> 284.64943698300823
<SOS> <SOS> they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call upon maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern  when kitty left them  she went boldly on with him alone <EOS> <EOS> 455.03718006704446
<SOS> <SOS> now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and  while her courage was high  she immediately said   mr darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be wounding your s <EOS> <EOS> 157.5030129563464
<SOS> <SOS> i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister <EOS> <EOS> 209.42028911822416
<SOS> <SOS> ever since i have known it  i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it <EOS> <EOS> 203.89164015485906
<SOS> <SOS> were it known to the rest of my family  i should not have merely my own gratitude to express <EOS> <EOS> 121.6092179035418
<SOS> <SOS> i did not think mr <EOS> <EOS> 120.74472443305525
<SOS> <SOS> gardiner was so little to be trusted <EOS> <EOS> 229.77777238721612
<SOS> <SOS> lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of course  i could not rest till i knew the particulars <EOS> <EOS> 161.21526447374205
<SOS> <SOS> let me thank you again and again  in the name of all my family  for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble  and bear so many mortifications  for the sake of discovering them <EOS> <EOS> 205.53299789116545
<SOS> <SOS> if you  will  thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself alone <EOS> <EOS> 308.6232048366931
<SOS> <SOS> that the wish of giving happiness to you  might add force to the other inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to deny <EOS> <EOS> 218.33202276784172
<SOS> <SOS> but your  family  owe me nothing <EOS> <EOS> 276.81582256822423
<SOS> <SOS> much as i respect them  i believe  i thought only of  you <EOS> <EOS> 144.31993724802703
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word <EOS> <EOS> 161.2419608865867
<SOS> <SOS> after a short pause  her companion added   you are too generous to trifle with me <EOS> <EOS> 305.07804655922274
<SOS> <SOS> if your feelings are still what they were last april  tell me so at once <EOS> <EOS> 256.9194044646757
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak  and immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand  that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure  his present assurances <EOS> <EOS> 295.3135072849766
<SOS> <SOS> had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight  diffused over his face  became him  but  though she could not look  she could listen  and he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable <EOS> <EOS> 234.64718624092708
<SOS> <SOS> they walked on  without knowing in what direction <EOS> <EOS> 334.0191590535759
<SOS> <SOS> there was too much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any other objects <EOS> <EOS> 148.22873879403022
<SOS> <SOS> she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who  did  call on him in her return through london  and there relate her journey to longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter  which  in her ladyship s apprehension  peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew  which  she  had refused to give <EOS> <EOS> 220.51897366797232
<SOS> <SOS> but  unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly contrariwise <EOS> <EOS> 241.56898580036
<SOS> <SOS> i knew enough of your disposition to be certain  that  had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided against me  you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine  frankly and openly <EOS> <EOS> 215.4065313826985
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   yes  you know enough of my  frankness  to believe me capable of  that <EOS> <EOS> 276.12155769415017
<SOS> <SOS> after abusing you so abominably to your face  i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations <EOS> <EOS> 216.00430888275667
<SOS> <SOS> it was unpardonable <EOS> <EOS> 148.84790626770598
<SOS> <SOS> i cannot think of it without abhorrence <EOS> <EOS> 178.640957288238

<SOS> <SOS> the recollection of what i then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions during the whole of it  is now  and has been many months  inexpressibly painful to me <EOS> <EOS> 198.19298019635326
<SOS> <SOS> those were your words <EOS> <EOS> 330.30465307617567
<SOS> <SOS> you know not  you can scarcely conceive  how they have tortured me   though it was some time  i confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice <EOS> <EOS> 218.0352116010738
<SOS> <SOS> i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression <EOS> <EOS> 255.40367735125233
<SOS> <SOS> i can easily believe it <EOS> <EOS> 195.87414528383226
<SOS> <SOS> the turn of your countenance i shall never forget  as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way  that would induce you to accept me <EOS> <EOS> 146.14852623946518
<SOS> <SOS> oh <EOS> <EOS> 193.53072160514583
<SOS> <SOS> these recollections will not do at all <EOS> <EOS> 217.79488419707928
<SOS> <SOS> i assure you  that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it <EOS> <EOS> 139.61464650858858
<SOS> <SOS> darcy mentioned his letter <EOS> <EOS> 275.2278359136461
<SOS> <SOS> did it   said he   did it  soon  make you think better of me <EOS> <EOS> 153.29425652333256
<SOS> <SOS> did you  on reading it  give any credit to its contents <EOS> <EOS> 384.69985626397323
<SOS> <SOS> she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed <EOS> <EOS> 337.71869193582114
<SOS> <SOS> i knew   said he   that what i wrote must give you pain  but it was necessary <EOS> <EOS> 182.4753556067633
<SOS> <SOS> i hope you have destroyed the letter <EOS> <EOS> 121.36658280229193
<SOS> <SOS> i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me <EOS> <EOS> 419.36838101492117
<SOS> <SOS> the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i hope  quite so easily changed as that implies <EOS> <EOS> 226.0278552588232
<SOS> <SOS> the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so <EOS> <EOS> 202.83714549270547
<SOS> <SOS> the adieu is charity itself <EOS> <EOS> 194.93446679190623
<SOS> <SOS> the feelings of the person who wrote  and the person who received it  are now so widely different from what they were then  that every unpleasant circumstance attending it  ought to be forgotten <EOS> <EOS> 281.4320369172003
<SOS> <SOS> you must learn some of my philosophy <EOS> <EOS> 243.10408312577874
<SOS> <SOS> i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind <EOS> <EOS> 149.2772147661952
<SOS> <SOS> your  retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the contentment arising from them  is not of philosophy  but what is much better  of ignorance <EOS> <EOS> 211.3506707386496
<SOS> <SOS> but with  me   it is not so <EOS> <EOS> 67.55070700020501
<SOS> <SOS> painful recollections will intrude  which cannot  which ought not to be repelled <EOS> <EOS> 531.6193383588356
<SOS> <SOS> i have been a selfish being all my life  in practice  though not in principle <EOS> <EOS> 200.92313802997046
<SOS> <SOS> as a child i was taught what was  right   but i was not taught to correct my temper <EOS> <EOS> 218.81408561440003
<SOS> <SOS> unfortunately an only son   for many years an only  child   i was spoilt by my parents  who though good themselves   my father particularly  all that was benevolent and amiable   allowed  encouraged  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing  to care for none beyond my own family circle  to think meanly of all the rest of the world  to  wish  at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own <EOS> <EOS> 326.24842978331816
<SOS> <SOS> such i was  from eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been but for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 251.321506651579
<SOS> <SOS> what do i not owe you <EOS> <EOS> 148.8369114445166
<SOS> <SOS> by you  i was properly humbled <EOS> <EOS> 290.8555959095681
<SOS> <SOS> i came to you without a doubt of my reception <EOS> <EOS> 114.2404815063848
<SOS> <SOS> had you then persuaded yourself that i should <EOS> <EOS> 172.16540632951316
<SOS> <SOS> indeed i had <EOS> <EOS> 105.59919355916932
<SOS> <SOS> what will you think of my vanity <EOS> <EOS> 145.29458132704215
<SOS> <SOS> i believed you to be wishing  expecting my addresses <EOS> <EOS> 231.8349895642738
<SOS> <SOS> my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally i assure you <EOS> <EOS> 155.49950944922222
<SOS> <SOS> i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might often lead me wrong <EOS> <EOS> 381.26435593441454
<SOS> <SOS> hate you <EOS> <EOS> 221.59683534077027
<SOS> <SOS> you blamed me for coming <EOS> <EOS> 125.15140597703964
<SOS> <SOS> no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise <EOS> <EOS> 315.35030088297344
<SOS> <SOS> my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness  and i confess that i did not expect to receive  more  than my due <EOS> <EOS> 211.19904032031687
<SOS> <SOS> how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell  but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you <EOS> <EOS> 377.77801370863716
<SOS> <SOS> she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a subject to each  to be dwelt on farther <EOS> <EOS> 207.84359619898655
<SOS> <SOS> after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy to know any thing about it  they found at last  on examining their watches  that it was time to be at home <EOS> <EOS> 171.44731359065366
<SOS> <SOS> what could become of mr bingley and jane <EOS> <EOS> 123.12285668830235
<SOS> <SOS> was a wonder which introduced the discussion of  their  affairs <EOS> <EOS> 189.36665016050455
<SOS> <SOS> i must ask whether you were surprised <EOS> <EOS> 268.9719075897605
<SOS> <SOS> said elizabeth <EOS> <EOS> 112.99542983567714
<SOS> <SOS> when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen <EOS> <EOS> 218.719994725798
<SOS> <SOS> that is to say  you had given your permission <EOS> <EOS> 140.26874085681993
<SOS> <SOS> i guessed as much <EOS> <EOS> 195.36880533817813
<SOS> <SOS> and though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had been pretty much the case <EOS> <EOS> 107.05128276686439
<SOS> <SOS> i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs  absurd and impertinent <EOS> <EOS> 207.85691797329434
<SOS> <SOS> his surprise was great <EOS> <EOS> 155.3208406618041
<SOS> <SOS> i told him  moreover  that i believed myself mistaken in supposing  as i had done  that your sister was indifferent to him  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated  i felt no doubt of their happiness together <EOS> <EOS> 164.00436609345246
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend <EOS> <EOS> 231.00430124546907
<SOS> <SOS> did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you told him that my sister loved him  or merely from my information last spring <EOS> <EOS> 234.23668421849843
<SOS> <SOS> from the former <EOS> <EOS> 83.42921887944196
<SOS> <SOS> i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here  and i was convinced of her affection <EOS> <EOS> 243.33343450992325
<SOS> <SOS> bingley is most unaffectedly modest <EOS> <EOS> 470.8406887580531
<SOS> <SOS> his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case  but his reliance on mine  made every thing easy <EOS> <EOS> 354.98087908344985
<SOS> <SOS> but his anger  i am persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments <EOS> <EOS> 209.12154839431227
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable  but she checked herself <EOS> <EOS> 225.3576988136121
<SOS> <SOS> she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at  and it was rather too early to begin <EOS> <EOS> 125.90884164502951
<SOS> <SOS> in anticipating the happiness of bingley  which of course was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation till they reached the house <EOS> <EOS> 239.0212909550265
<SOS> <SOS> my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to <EOS> <EOS> 134.24457812323962
<SOS> <SOS> was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room  and from all the others when they sat down to table <EOS> <EOS> 148.25075553184183
<SOS> <SOS> she had only to say in reply  that they had wandered about  till she was beyond her own knowledge <EOS> <EOS> 158.42187527102018
<SOS> <SOS> she coloured as she spoke  but neither that  nor any thing else  awakened a suspicion of the truth <EOS> <EOS> 316.4495444997887
<SOS> <SOS> the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged were silent <EOS> <EOS> 278.30014937091795
<SOS> <SOS> darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth  and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather  knew  that she was happy  than  felt  herself to be so  for  besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils before her <EOS> <EOS> 244.95582687380121
<SOS> <SOS> she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known  she was aware that no one liked him but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a  dislike  which not all his fortune and consequence might do away <EOS> <EOS> 207.0763948590442
<SOS> <SOS> at night she opened her heart to jane <EOS> <EOS> 185.15440064565038
<SOS> <SOS> though suspicion was very far from missennet s general habits  she was absolutely incredulous here <EOS> <EOS> 467.4514004964872
<SOS> <SOS> you are joking  lizzy <EOS> <EOS> 152.95552074776947
<SOS> <SOS> this cannot be <EOS> <EOS> 139.56680196335077
<SOS> <SOS> engaged to mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 80.38225373795295
<SOS> <SOS> no  no  you shall not deceive me <EOS> <EOS> 198.60818358901847
<SOS> <SOS> i know it to be impossible <EOS> <EOS> 87.34461413932293
<SOS> <SOS> this is a wretched beginning indeed <EOS> <EOS> 328.6088727715068
<SOS> <SOS> my sole dependence was on you  and i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not <EOS> <EOS> 148.15116642952268
<SOS> <SOS> yet  indeed  i am in earnest <EOS> <EOS> 201.96574937147986
<SOS> <SOS> i speak nothing but the truth <EOS> <EOS> 179.2867993094397
<SOS> <SOS> he still loves me  and we are engaged <EOS> <EOS> 267.42737510520107
<SOS> <SOS> jane looked at her doubtingly <EOS> <EOS> 109.60980790452392
<SOS> <SOS> it cannot be <EOS> <EOS> 83.01544554231191
<SOS> <SOS> i know how much you dislike him <EOS> <EOS> 164.1643557263518
<SOS> <SOS> you know nothing of the matter <EOS> <EOS> 118.85560752648918
<SOS> <SOS> that  is all to be forgot <EOS> <EOS> 125.46341511824028
<SOS> <SOS> perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now <EOS> <EOS> 114.48481233298153
<SOS> <SOS> but in such cases as these  a good memory is unpardonable <EOS> <EOS> 313.2930482263885
<SOS> <SOS> this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself <EOS> <EOS> 235.15491940391826
<SOS> <SOS> missennet still looked all amazement <EOS> <EOS> 598.7863947244583
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth again  and more seriously assured her of its truth <EOS> <EOS> 288.92828223201604
<SOS> <SOS> can it be really so <EOS> <EOS> 175.20294717197922
<SOS> <SOS> yet now i must believe you   cried jane <EOS> <EOS> 274.4945822058763
<SOS> <SOS> there can be no doubt of that <EOS> <EOS> 110.84500136609881
<SOS> <SOS> it is settled between us already  that we are to be the happiest couple in the world <EOS> <EOS> 199.64951720516643
<SOS> <SOS> shall you like to have such a brother <EOS> <EOS> 153.11407363954078
<SOS> <SOS> but we considered it  we talked of it as impossible <EOS> <EOS> 273.12116620645133
<SOS> <SOS> and do you really love him quite well enough <EOS> <EOS> 297.997169078143
<SOS> <SOS> oh  lizzy <EOS> <EOS> 283.6474401804397
<SOS> <SOS> do any thing rather than marry without affection <EOS> <EOS> 642.5955069105173
<SOS> <SOS> are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do <EOS> <EOS> 145.22961026491618
<SOS> <SOS> oh  yes <EOS> <EOS> 263.52718268373434
<SOS> <SOS> you will only think i feel  more  than i ought to do  when i tell you all <EOS> <EOS> 145.01376538974532
<SOS> <SOS> what do you mean <EOS> <EOS> 158.10809478253114
<SOS> <SOS> my dearest sister  now  be  be serious <EOS> <EOS> 228.39663487982608
<SOS> <SOS> i want to talk very seriously <EOS> <EOS> 268.03929543311824
<SOS> <SOS> will you tell me how long you have loved him <EOS> <EOS> 200.48296725264103
<SOS> <SOS> it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it began <EOS> <EOS> 185.90215646603087
<SOS> <SOS> but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley <EOS> <EOS> 277.2534380967117
<SOS> <SOS> another intreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment <EOS> <EOS> 358.88165669325514
<SOS> <SOS> when convinced on that article  missennet had nothing farther to wish <EOS> <EOS> 396.65232976131244
<SOS> <SOS> now i am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as myself <EOS> <EOS> 129.11095457364522
<SOS> <SOS> i always had a value for him <EOS> <EOS> 164.3937364793832
<SOS> <SOS> but lizzy  you have been very sly  very reserved with me <EOS> <EOS> 140.2799193873465
<SOS> <SOS> how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton <EOS> <EOS> 277.647772767611
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy <EOS> <EOS> 113.21904464034877
<SOS> <SOS> she had been unwilling to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend <EOS> <EOS> 134.6232781399324
<SOS> <SOS> but now she would no longer conceal from her  his share in lydia s marriage <EOS> <EOS> 197.87744506359672
<SOS> <SOS> all was acknowledged  and half the night spent in conversation <EOS> <EOS> 290.3286754308032
<SOS> <SOS> cried mr <EOS> <EOS> 336.1168769352191
<SOS> <SOS> bennet  as she stood at a window the next morning   if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley <EOS> <EOS> 245.26897067201736
<SOS> <SOS> what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here <EOS> <EOS> 253.91279827926067
<SOS> <SOS> i had no notion but he would go a shooting  or something or other  and not disturb us with his company <EOS> <EOS> 148.90669794119273
<SOS> <SOS> lizzy  you must walk out with him again  that he may not be in bingley s way <EOS> <EOS> 118.81697726542627
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal  yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet <EOS> <EOS> 275.51091993135395
<SOS> <SOS> it is a nice long walk  and mr darcy has never seen the view <EOS> <EOS> 124.3265922329813
<SOS> <SOS> wont it  kitty <EOS> <EOS> 147.60217239115093
<SOS> <SOS> kitty owned that she had rather stay at home <EOS> <EOS> 268.22759779445545
<SOS> <SOS> darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently consented <EOS> <EOS> 285.25698425637495
<SOS> <SOS> as she went up stairs to get ready  mr <EOS> <EOS> 377.65678306430306
<SOS> <SOS> bennet followed her  saying   i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself <EOS> <EOS> 248.85908143146378
<SOS> <SOS> so  do not put yourself to inconvenience <EOS> <EOS> 331.22856084370244
<SOS> <SOS> during their walk  it was resolved that mr bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening <EOS> <EOS> 110.6694231710119
<SOS> <SOS> she could not determine how her mother would take it  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man <EOS> <EOS> 262.66427777720367
<SOS> <SOS> in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while pretending to admire her work  said in a whisper   go to your father  he wants you in the library <EOS> <EOS> 264.7062889809982
<SOS> <SOS> she was gone directly <EOS> <EOS> 183.3206444223528
<SOS> <SOS> her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious <EOS> <EOS> 263.27189499798044
<SOS> <SOS> lizzy   said he   what are you doing <EOS> <EOS> 266.9325581092022
<SOS> <SOS> are you out of your senses  to be accepting this man <EOS> <EOS> 190.84230733347255
<SOS> <SOS> it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give  but they were now necessary  and she assured him with some confusion  of her attachment to mr darcy <EOS> <EOS> 142.6791580304782
<SOS> <SOS> or in other words  you are determined to have him <EOS> <EOS> 190.66704293961476
<SOS> <SOS> he is rich  to be sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane <EOS> <EOS> 206.0814426222614
<SOS> <SOS> but will they make you happy <EOS> <EOS> 283.2155955502099
<SOS> <SOS> have you any other objection   said elizabeth   than your belief of my indifference <EOS> <EOS> 268.01410467400507
<SOS> <SOS> none at all <EOS> <EOS> 173.7845194119029
<SOS> <SOS> we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of man  but this would be nothing if you really liked him <EOS> <EOS> 253.74002141066964
<SOS> <SOS> i do  i do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   i love him <EOS> <EOS> 139.6447447705927
<SOS> <SOS> indeed he has no improper pride <EOS> <EOS> 249.47772335253288
<SOS> <SOS> you do not know what he really is  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms <EOS> <EOS> 185.12969049116114
<SOS> <SOS> lizzy   said her father   i have given him my consent <EOS> <EOS> 143.08230146092194
<SOS> <SOS> he is the kind of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse any thing  which he condescended to ask <EOS> <EOS> 196.89203021501922
<SOS> <SOS> i now give it to  you   if you are resolved on having him <EOS> <EOS> 139.89327658238122
<SOS> <SOS> but let me advise you to think better of it <EOS> <EOS> 194.76626087962788
<SOS> <SOS> i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable  unless you truly esteemed your husband  unless you looked up to him as a superior <EOS> <EOS> 314.21523265424014
<SOS> <SOS> you could scarcely escape discredit and misery <EOS> <EOS> 569.1855037807542
<SOS> <SOS> my child  let me not have the grief of seeing  you  unable to respect your partner in life <EOS> <EOS> 273.0312774593018
<SOS> <SOS> you know not what you are about <EOS> <EOS> 117.58526521636028
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply  and at length  by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had stood the test of many months suspense  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father s incredulity  and reconcile him to the match <EOS> <EOS> 212.28529958072065
<SOS> <SOS> well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   i have no more to say <EOS> <EOS> 155.4008034478918
<SOS> <SOS> if this be the case  he deserves you <EOS> <EOS> 192.51501587580725

<SOS> <SOS> bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law  that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his opinion <EOS> <EOS> 252.52404172070717
<SOS> <SOS> elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him  and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem <EOS> <EOS> 192.9667560399986

<SOS> <SOS> how could you begin <EOS> <EOS> 250.83541886759994
<SOS> <SOS> said she <EOS> <EOS> 99.4091061240576
<SOS> <SOS> i can comprehend your going on charmingly  when you had once made a beginning  but what could set you off in the first place <EOS> <EOS> 261.76625960611136
<SOS> <SOS> i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the words  which laid the foundation <EOS> <EOS> 303.6575470987561
<SOS> <SOS> it is too long ago <EOS> <EOS> 211.6533494426173
<SOS> <SOS> i was in the middle before i knew that i  had  begun <EOS> <EOS> 113.19446829882803
<SOS> <SOS> now be sincere  did you admire me for my impertinence <EOS> <EOS> 336.8035822321202
<SOS> <SOS> for the liveliness of your mind  i did <EOS> <EOS> 107.4319144168297
<SOS> <SOS> you may as well call it impertinence at once <EOS> <EOS> 312.3867800270961
<SOS> <SOS> it was very little less <EOS> <EOS> 81.75723444004161
<SOS> <SOS> i roused  and interested you  because i was so unlike  them <EOS> <EOS> 277.4023472201443
<SOS> <SOS> had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and in your heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you <EOS> <EOS> 269.9234448020607
<SOS> <SOS> there  i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it perfectly reasonable <EOS> <EOS> 273.47951808242055
<SOS> <SOS> to be sure  you knew no actual good of me  but nobody thinks of  that  when they fall in love <EOS> <EOS> 281.9828180625664
<SOS> <SOS> was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane  while she was ill at netherfield <EOS> <EOS> 231.78472894154189

<SOS> <SOS> but make a virtue of it by all means <EOS> <EOS> 144.01853686723885
<SOS> <SOS> my good qualities are under your protection  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible  and  in return  it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last <EOS> <EOS> 242.15348897876083
<SOS> <SOS> what made you so shy of me  when you first called  and afterwards dined here <EOS> <EOS> 340.6543945064623
<SOS> <SOS> why  especially  when you called  did you look as if you did not care about me <EOS> <EOS> 272.67816312667924
<SOS> <SOS> because you were grave and silent  and gave me no encouragement <EOS> <EOS> 305.4155176857989
<SOS> <SOS> but i was embarrassed <EOS> <EOS> 159.01730445313473
<SOS> <SOS> you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner <EOS> <EOS> 161.91460704964646
<SOS> <SOS> a man who had felt less  might <EOS> <EOS> 234.65614614591766
<SOS> <SOS> how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give  and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it <EOS> <EOS> 127.56166177697185
<SOS> <SOS> but i wonder how long you  would  have gone on  if you had been left to yourself <EOS> <EOS> 141.57468317540324
<SOS> <SOS> my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect <EOS> <EOS> 331.7147084245995

<SOS> <SOS> lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her happy  for she loves to be of use <EOS> <EOS> 219.4049837984861
<SOS> <SOS> was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed <EOS> <EOS> 234.307618755889
<SOS> <SOS> or had you intended any more serious consequence <EOS> <EOS> 398.9187211683436
<SOS> <SOS> my avowed one  or what i avowed to myself  was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley  and if she were  to make the confession to him which i have since made <EOS> <EOS> 186.06141904546823
<SOS> <SOS> shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine  what is to befall her <EOS> <EOS> 168.79480285553603
