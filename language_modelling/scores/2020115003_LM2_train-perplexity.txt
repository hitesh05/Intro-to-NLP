<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr <EOS>	3.7374475045867377

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my <EOS>	6.920325440087856
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham.wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison.but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry.the necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurd.i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country.but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.i had often seen him in love before.at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their <EOS>	3.056481017812779
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be <EOS>	6.464084167267213
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard.but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult <EOS>	3.1257387845624933
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them.with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my <EOS>	3.895156601594993
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally <EOS>	5.991655910802866

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an <EOS>	2.763256247270559

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy had been at her sisters <EOS>	3.7906539373686012

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for <EOS>	2.0383759535139094
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in <EOS>	2.3314752452971583
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the <EOS>	2.1256625888770806
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his character was to speak for <EOS>	3.1201716918913704

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace <EOS>	3.0030873835223995
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow <EOS>	2.1648680088616263
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say <EOS>	2.192908862258369

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ <EOS>	1.9991253919664196
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly <EOS>	1.9493363600639269

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> every thing being settled between _them_ mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came <EOS>	2.1548845251472595
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next <EOS>	2.4494335520821195
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the <EOS>	2.2304126229482777

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was <EOS>	1.9631160749142234
