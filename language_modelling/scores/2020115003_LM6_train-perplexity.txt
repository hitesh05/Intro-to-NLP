<SOS> <SOS> she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible <EOS> <EOS> 142.98673636229952
<SOS> <SOS> it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble <EOS> <EOS> 210.72787707383566

<SOS> <SOS> cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature <EOS> <EOS> 170.55262391714905

<SOS> <SOS> she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve <EOS> <EOS> 144.71977700785084
<SOS> <SOS> she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes <EOS> <EOS> 112.75650872315107
<SOS> <SOS> he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey <EOS> <EOS> 47.34851253193622

<SOS> <SOS> and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and mississy  as glib as you like  said it was half past kissing time  time to kiss again <EOS> <EOS> 243.71818896497626
<SOS> <SOS> but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early <EOS> <EOS> 122.47773905173324

<SOS> <SOS> cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch  listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set <EOS> <EOS> 227.3594307638812
<SOS> <SOS> his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones <EOS> <EOS> 47.557207865819024
<SOS> <SOS> cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order <EOS> <EOS> 147.77630003829847
<SOS> <SOS> then they sang the second verse of the  tantum ergo  and canon o hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time <EOS> <EOS> 229.9325378507933
<SOS> <SOS> it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets <EOS> <EOS> 111.92344304959259
