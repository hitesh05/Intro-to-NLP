The Google drive link for pretrained models and embeddings can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U_uz-i049g3wxv91Cng9QMFamFE2PIyD?usp=sharing)

It has 4 models:
1. Elmo pretrained on SST dataset
2. Elmo finetuned on SST dataset
3. Elmo pretrained on NLI dataset
4. Elmo finetuned on NLI dataset

It is recommended that you use colab notebook to run the file rather than running the original python file. If you want to test it locally, the ipynb file has been submitted along with it for easy running and analysis.

The link for the colab notebook is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uMnoDiT_IzUdG2QNq7HPorRHo2GDiHhG?usp=sharing)


To run the py file:

```
python3 A4.py
```
