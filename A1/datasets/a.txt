 <SOS>  pride   prejudice <EOS> <SOS>  chapter i <EOS> <SOS>  it is a truth universally acknowledged  that a single man in possession of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife <EOS> <SOS>  however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood  this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families  that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters <EOS> <SOS>   my dear mr bennet   said his lady to him one day   have you heard that netherfield park is let at last <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet replied that he had not <EOS> <SOS>   but it is   returned she   for mr <EOS> <SOS>  long has just been here  and she told me all about it <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet made no answer <EOS> <SOS>   do not you want to know who has taken it <EOS> <SOS>   cried his wife impatiently <EOS> <SOS>    you  want to tell me  and i have no objection to hearing it <EOS> <SOS>   this was invitation enough <EOS> <SOS>   why  my dear  you must know  mr <EOS> <SOS>  long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england  that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place  and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately  that he is to take possession before michaelmas  and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week <EOS> <SOS>    what is his name <EOS> <SOS>    bingley <EOS> <SOS>    is he married or single <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  single  my dear  to be sure <EOS> <SOS>  a single man of large fortune  four or five thousand a year <EOS> <SOS>  what a fine thing for our girls <EOS> <SOS>    how so <EOS> <SOS>  how can it affect them <EOS> <SOS>    my dear mr bennet   replied his wife   how can you be so tiresome <EOS> <SOS>  you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them <EOS> <SOS>    is that his design in settling here <EOS> <SOS>    design <EOS> <SOS>  nonsense  how can you talk so <EOS> <SOS>  but it is very likely that he  may  fall in love with one of them  and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes <EOS> <SOS>    i see no occasion for that <EOS> <SOS>  you and the girls may go  or you may send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for as you are as handsome as any of them  mr bingley might like you the best of the party <EOS> <SOS>    my dear  you flatter me <EOS> <SOS>  i certainly  have  had my share of beauty  but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now <EOS> <SOS>  when a woman has five grown up daughters  she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty <EOS> <SOS>    in such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of <EOS> <SOS>    but  my dear  you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood <EOS> <SOS>    it is more than i engage for  i assure you <EOS> <SOS>    but consider your daughters <EOS> <SOS>  only think what an establishment it would be for one of them <EOS> <SOS>  sir william and lady lucas are determined to go  merely on that account  for in general you know they visit no new comers <EOS> <SOS>  indeed you must go  for it will be impossible for  us  to visit him  if you do not <EOS> <SOS>    you are over scrupulous surely <EOS> <SOS>  i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you  and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls  though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy <EOS> <SOS>    i desire you will do no such thing <EOS> <SOS>  lizzy is not a bit better than the others  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane  nor half so good humoured as lydia <EOS> <SOS>  but you are always giving  her  the preference <EOS> <SOS>    they have none of them much to recommend them   replied he   they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters <EOS> <SOS>    mr bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way <EOS> <SOS>  you take delight in vexing me <EOS> <SOS>  you have no compassion on my poor nerves <EOS> <SOS>    you mistake me  my dear <EOS> <SOS>  i have a high respect for your nerves <EOS> <SOS>  they are my old friends <EOS> <SOS>  i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least <EOS> <SOS>    ah <EOS> <SOS>  you do not know what i suffer <EOS> <SOS>    but i hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood <EOS> <SOS>    it will be no use to us  if twenty such should come since you will not visit them <EOS> <SOS>    depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  i will visit them all <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour  reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character <EOS> <SOS>   her  mind was less difficult to develope <EOS> <SOS>  she was a woman of mean understanding  little information  and uncertain temper <EOS> <SOS>  when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous <EOS> <SOS>  the business of her life was to get her daughters married  its solace was visiting and news <EOS> <SOS>  chapter ii <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>  he had always intended to visit him  though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go  and till the evening after the visit was paid  she had no knowledge of it <EOS> <SOS>  it was then disclosed in the following manner <EOS> <SOS>  observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat  he suddenly addressed her with   i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy <EOS> <SOS>    we are not in a way to know  what  mr bingley likes   said her mother resentfully   since we are not to visit <EOS> <SOS>    but you forget  mama   said elizabeth   that we shall meet him at the assemblies  and that mr <EOS> <SOS>  long has promised to introduce him <EOS> <SOS>    i do not believe mr <EOS> <SOS>  long will do any such thing <EOS> <SOS>  she has two nieces of her own <EOS> <SOS>  she is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and i have no opinion of her <EOS> <SOS>    no more have i   said mr bennet   and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet deigned not to make any reply  but unable to contain herself  began scolding one of her daughters <EOS> <SOS>   don t keep coughing so  kitty  for heaven s sake <EOS> <SOS>  have a little compassion on my nerves <EOS> <SOS>  you tear them to pieces <EOS> <SOS>    kitty has no discretion in her coughs   said her father   she times them ill <EOS> <SOS>    i do not cough for my own amusement   replied kitty fretfully <EOS> <SOS>   when is your next ball to be  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>    to morrow fortnight <EOS> <SOS>    aye  so it is   cried her mother   and mr <EOS> <SOS>  long does not come back till the day before  so  it will be impossible for her to introduce him  for she will not know him herself <EOS> <SOS>    then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and introduce mr bingley to  her  <EOS> <SOS>    impossible  mr bennet  impossible  when i am not acquainted with him myself  how can you be so teazing <EOS> <SOS>    i honour your circumspection <EOS> <SOS>  a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little <EOS> <SOS>  one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight <EOS> <SOS>  but if  we  do not venture  somebody else will  and after all  mr <EOS> <SOS>  long and her nieces must stand their chance  and therefore  as she will think it an act of kindness  if you decline the office  i will take it on myself <EOS> <SOS>   the girls stared at their father <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet said only   nonsense  nonsense <EOS> <SOS>    what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation <EOS> <SOS>   cried he <EOS> <SOS>   do you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that is laid on them  as nonsense <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot quite agree with you  there  <EOS> <SOS>  what say you  mary <EOS> <SOS>  for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know  and read great books  and make extracts <EOS> <SOS>   mary wished to say something very sensible  but knew not how <EOS> <SOS>   while mary is adjusting her ideas   he continued   let us return to mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>    i am sick of mr bingley   cried his wife <EOS> <SOS>   i am sorry to hear  that   but why did not you tell me so before <EOS> <SOS>  if i had known as much this morning  i certainly would not have called on him <EOS> <SOS>  it is very unlucky  but as i have actually paid the visit  we cannot escape the acquaintance now <EOS> <SOS>   the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  that of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though when the first tumult of joy was over  she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while <EOS> <SOS>   how good it was in you  my dear mr bennet <EOS> <SOS>  but i knew i should persuade you at last <EOS> <SOS>  i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  well  how pleased i am <EOS> <SOS>  and it is such a good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning  and never said a word about it till now <EOS> <SOS>    now  kitty  you may cough as much as you chuse   said mr bennet  and  as he spoke  he left the room  fatigued with the raptures of his wife <EOS> <SOS>   what an excellent father you have  girls   said she  when the door was shut <EOS> <SOS>   i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness  or me either  for that matter <EOS> <SOS>  at our time of life  it is not so pleasant i can tell you  to be making new acquaintance every day  but for your sakes  we would do any thing <EOS> <SOS>  lydia  my love  though you  are  the youngest  i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>   said lydia stoutly   i am not afraid  for though i  am  the youngest  i m the tallest <EOS> <SOS>   the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet s visit  and determining when they should ask him to dinner <EOS> <SOS>  chapter iii <EOS> <SOS>  not all that mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  however  with the assistance of her five daughters  could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>  they attacked him in various ways  with barefaced questions  ingenious suppositions  and distant surmises  but he eluded the skill of them all  and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas <EOS> <SOS>  her report was highly favourable <EOS> <SOS>  sir william had been delighted with him <EOS> <SOS>  he was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely agreeable  and to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party <EOS> <SOS>  nothing could be more delightful <EOS> <SOS>  to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love  and very lively hopes of mr bingley s heart were entertained <EOS> <SOS>   if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet to her husband   and all the others equally well married  i shall have nothing to wish for <EOS> <SOS>   in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet s visit  and sat about ten minutes with him in his library <EOS> <SOS>  he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose beauty he had heard much  but he saw only the father <EOS> <SOS>  the ladies were somewhat more fortunate  for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window  that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse <EOS> <SOS>  an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and already had mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred it all <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day  and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation   c <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was quite disconcerted <EOS> <SOS>  she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire  and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another  and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be <EOS> <SOS>  lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly <EOS> <SOS>  the girls grieved over such a number of ladies  but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing  that instead of twelve  he had brought only six with him from london  his five sisters and a cousin <EOS> <SOS>  and when the party entered the assembly room  it consisted of only five altogether  mr bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and another young man <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like  he had a pleasant countenance  and easy  unaffected manners <EOS> <SOS>  his sisters were fine women  with an air of decided fashion <EOS> <SOS>  his brother in law  mr hurst  merely looked the gentleman  but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome features  noble mien  and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance  of his having ten thousand a year <EOS> <SOS>  the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man  the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley  and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be proud  to be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be compared with his friend <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room  he was lively and unreserved  danced every dance  was angry that the ball closed so early  and talked of giving one himself at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  such amiable qualities must speak for themselves <EOS> <SOS>  what a contrast between him and his friend <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy danced only once with mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and once with missingley  declined being introduced to any other lady  and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party <EOS> <SOS>  his character was decided <EOS> <SOS>  he was the proudest  most disagreeable man in the world  and every body hoped that he would never come there again <EOS> <SOS>  amongst the most violent against him was mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  whose dislike of his general behaviour  was sharpened into particular resentment  by his having slighted one of her daughters <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen  to sit down for two dances  and during part of that time  mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley  who came from the dance for a few minutes  to press his friend to join it <EOS> <SOS>   come  darcy   said he   i must have you dance <EOS> <SOS>  i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner <EOS> <SOS>  you had much better dance <EOS> <SOS>    i certainly shall not <EOS> <SOS>  you know how i detest it  unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner <EOS> <SOS>  at such an assembly as this  it would be insupportable <EOS> <SOS>  your sisters are engaged  and there is not another woman in the room  whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with <EOS> <SOS>    i would not be so fastidious as you are   cried bingley   for a kingdom <EOS> <SOS>  upon my honour  i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life  as i have this evening  and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty <EOS> <SOS>     you  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room   said mr darcy  looking at the eldest missennet <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld <EOS> <SOS>  but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very pretty  and i dare say  very agreeable <EOS> <SOS>  do let me ask my partner to introduce you <EOS> <SOS>    which do you mean <EOS> <SOS>   and turning round  he looked for a moment at elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly said   she is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt  me   and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men <EOS> <SOS>  you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles  for you are wasting your time with me <EOS> <SOS>   mr bingley followed his advice <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy walked off  and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him <EOS> <SOS>  she told the story however with great spirit among her friends  for she had a lively  playful disposition  which delighted in any thing ridiculous <EOS> <SOS>  the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley had danced with her twice  and she had been distinguished by his sisters <EOS> <SOS>  jane was as much gratified by this  as her mother could be  though in a quieter way <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth felt jane s pleasure <EOS> <SOS>  mary had heard herself mentioned to missingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood  and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners  which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball <EOS> <SOS>  they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which they were the principal inhabitants <EOS> <SOS>  they found mr bennet still up <EOS> <SOS>  with a book he was regardless of time  and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations <EOS> <SOS>  he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed  but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear mr bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a most delightful evening  a most excellent ball <EOS> <SOS>  i wish you had been there <EOS> <SOS>  jane was so admired  nothing could be like it <EOS> <SOS>  every body said how well she looked  and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful  and danced with her twice <EOS> <SOS>  only think of  that  my dear  he actually danced with her twice  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time <EOS> <SOS>  first of all  he asked missucas <EOS> <SOS>  i was so vexed to see him stand up with her  but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody can  you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance <EOS> <SOS>  so  he enquired who she was  and got introduced  and asked her for the two next <EOS> <SOS>  then  the two third he danced with missing  and the two fourth with maria lucas  and the two fifth with jane again  and the two sixth with lizzy  and the boulanger       if he had had any compassion for  me    cried her husband impatiently   he would not have danced half so much <EOS> <SOS>  for god s sake  say no more of his partners <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear   continued mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   i am quite delighted with him <EOS> <SOS>  he is so excessively handsome <EOS> <SOS>  and his sisters are charming women <EOS> <SOS>  i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses <EOS> <SOS>  i dare say the lace upon mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst s gown      here she was interrupted again <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet protested against any description of finery <EOS> <SOS>  she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   but i can assure you   she added   that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting  his  fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid man  not at all worth pleasing <EOS> <SOS>  so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him <EOS> <SOS>  he walked here  and he walked there  fancying himself so very great <EOS> <SOS>  not handsome enough to dance with <EOS> <SOS>  i wish you had been there  my dear  to have given him one of your set downs <EOS> <SOS>  i quite detest the man <EOS> <SOS>   chapter iv <EOS> <SOS>  when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before  expressed to her sister how very much she admired him <EOS> <SOS>   he is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible  good humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners <EOS> <SOS>   so much ease  with such perfect good breeding <EOS> <SOS>    he is also handsome   replied elizabeth   which a young man ought likewise to be  if he possibly can <EOS> <SOS>  his character is thereby complete <EOS> <SOS>    i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time <EOS> <SOS>  i did not expect such a compliment <EOS> <SOS>    did not you <EOS> <SOS>   i  did for you <EOS> <SOS>  but that is one great difference between us <EOS> <SOS>  compliments always take  you  by surprise  and  me  never <EOS> <SOS>  what could be more natural than his asking you again <EOS> <SOS>  he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room <EOS> <SOS>  no thanks to his gallantry for that <EOS> <SOS>  well  he certainly is very agreeable  and i give you leave to like him <EOS> <SOS>  you have liked many a stupider person <EOS> <SOS>    dear lizzy <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  you are a great deal too apt you know  to like people in general <EOS> <SOS>  you never see a fault in any body <EOS> <SOS>  all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes <EOS> <SOS>  i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life <EOS> <SOS>    i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one  but i always speak what i think <EOS> <SOS>    i know you do  and it is  that  which makes the wonder <EOS> <SOS>  with  your  good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others <EOS> <SOS>  affectation of candour is common enough   one meets it every where <EOS> <SOS>  but to be candid without ostentation or design  to take the good of every body s character and make it still better  and say nothing of the bad  belongs to you alone <EOS> <SOS>  and so  you like this man s sisters too  do you <EOS> <SOS>  their manners are not equal to his <EOS> <SOS>    certainly not  at first <EOS> <SOS>  but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them <EOS> <SOS>  missingley is to live with her brother and keep his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister  and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself  she was very little disposed to approve them <EOS> <SOS>  they were in fact very fine ladies  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased  nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it  but proud and conceited <EOS> <SOS>  they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and of associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of others <EOS> <SOS>  they were of a respectable family in the north of england  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an estate  but did not live to do it <EOS> <SOS>   mr bingley intended it likewise  and sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor  it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield  and leave the next generation to purchase <EOS> <SOS>  his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own  but though he was now established only as a tenant  missingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table  nor was mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune  less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley had not been of age two years  when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house <EOS> <SOS>  he did look at it and into it for half an hour  was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms  satisfied with what the owner said in its praise  and took it immediately <EOS> <SOS>  between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship  in spite of a great opposition of character <EOS> <SOS>   bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness  openness  ductility of his temper  though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own  and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied <EOS> <SOS>  on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance  and of his judgment the highest opinion <EOS> <SOS>  in understanding darcy was the superior <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was by no means deficient  but darcy was clever <EOS> <SOS>  he was at the same time haughty  reserved  and fastidious  and his manners  though well bred  were not inviting <EOS> <SOS>  in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually giving offence <EOS> <SOS>  the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic <EOS> <SOS>  bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life  every body had been most kind and attentive to him  there had been no formality  no stiffness  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  and as to missennet  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful <EOS> <SOS>  darcy  on the contrary  had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion  for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest  and from none received either attention or pleasure <EOS> <SOS>  missennet he acknowledged to be pretty  but she smiled too much <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and her sister allowed it to be so  but still they admired her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl  and one whom they should not object to know more of <EOS> <SOS>  missennet was therefore established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose <EOS> <SOS>  chapter v <EOS> <SOS>  within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate <EOS> <SOS>  sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton  where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king  during his mayoralty <EOS> <SOS>  the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly <EOS> <SOS>  it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town  and quitting them both  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge  where he could think with pleasure of his own importance  and unshackled by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world <EOS> <SOS>  for though elated by his rank  it did not render him supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to every body <EOS> <SOS>  by nature inoffensive  friendly and obliging  his presentation at st <EOS> <SOS>  james s had made him courteous <EOS> <SOS>  lady lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>   they had several children <EOS> <SOS>  the eldest of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about twenty seven  was elizabeth s intimate friend <EOS> <SOS>  that the missucases and the missennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate <EOS> <SOS>    you  began the evening well  charlotte   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet with civil self command to missucas <EOS> <SOS>    you  were mr bingley s first choice <EOS> <SOS>    yes   but he seemed to like his second better <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>   you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice <EOS> <SOS>  to be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her  indeed i rather believe he  did   i heard something about it  but i hardly know what  something about mr robinson <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson  did not i mention it to you <EOS> <SOS>  mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies  and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room  and  which  he thought the prettiest <EOS> <SOS>  and his answering immediately to the last question  oh <EOS> <SOS>  the eldest missennet beyond a doubt  there cannot be two opinions on that point <EOS> <SOS>    upon my word <EOS> <SOS>   well  that was very decided indeed  that does seem as if    but however  it may all come to nothing you know <EOS> <SOS>     my  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   eliza   said charlotte <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend  is he <EOS> <SOS>   poor eliza <EOS> <SOS>   to be only just  tolerable  <EOS> <SOS>    i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips <EOS> <SOS>    are you quite sure  ma am <EOS> <SOS>   is not there a little mistake <EOS> <SOS>   said jane <EOS> <SOS>    i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her <EOS> <SOS>    aye  because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and he could not help answering her   but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to <EOS> <SOS>    missingley told me   said jane   that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  with  them  he is remarkably agreeable <EOS> <SOS>    i do not believe a word of it  my dear <EOS> <SOS>  if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mr <EOS> <SOS>  long <EOS> <SOS>  but i can guess how it was  every body says that he is ate up with pride  and i dare say he had heard somehow that mr <EOS> <SOS>  long does not keep a carriage  and had come to the ball in a hack chaise <EOS> <SOS>    i do not mind his not talking to mr <EOS> <SOS>  long   said missucas   but i wish he had danced with eliza <EOS> <SOS>    another time  lizzy   said her mother   i would not dance with  him   if i were you <EOS> <SOS>    i believe  ma am  i may safely promise you  never  to dance with him <EOS> <SOS>    his pride   said missucas   does not offend  me  so much as pride often does  because there is an excuse for it <EOS> <SOS>  one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune  every thing in his favour  should think highly of himself <EOS> <SOS>  if i may so express it  he has a  right  to be proud <EOS> <SOS>    that is very true   replied elizabeth   and i could easily forgive  his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine  <EOS> <SOS>    pride   observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections   is a very common failing i believe <EOS> <SOS>  by all that i have ever read  i am convinced that it is very common indeed  that human nature is particularly prone to it  and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other  real or imaginary <EOS> <SOS>  vanity and pride are different things  though the words are often used synonimously <EOS> <SOS>  a person may be proud without being vain <EOS> <SOS>  pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves  vanity to what we would have others think of us <EOS> <SOS>    if i were as rich as mr darcy   cried a young lucas who came with his sisters   i should not care how proud i was <EOS> <SOS>  i would keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine every day <EOS> <SOS>    then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly <EOS> <SOS>   the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare that she would  and the argument ended only with the visit <EOS> <SOS>  chapter vi <EOS> <SOS>  the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  the visit was returned in due form <EOS> <SOS>  missennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley  and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to  a wish of being better acquainted with  them   was expressed towards the two eldest <EOS> <SOS>  by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure  but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body  hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  though their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration <EOS> <SOS>  it was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire her  and to  her  it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first  and was in a way to be very much in love  but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general  since jane united with great strength of feeling  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner  which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent <EOS> <SOS>  she mentioned this to her friend missucas <EOS> <SOS>   it may perhaps be pleasant   replied charlotte   to be able to impose on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded <EOS> <SOS>  if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose the opportunity of fixing him  and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark <EOS> <SOS>  there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it is not safe to leave any to itself <EOS> <SOS>  we can all  begin  freely  a slight preference is natural enough  but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement <EOS> <SOS>  in nine cases out of ten  a woman had better shew  more  affection than she feels <EOS> <SOS>  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he may never do more than like her  if she does not help him on <EOS> <SOS>    but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow <EOS> <SOS>  if  i  can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too <EOS> <SOS>    remember  eliza  that he does not know jane s disposition as you do <EOS> <SOS>    but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to conceal it  he must find it out <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her <EOS> <SOS>  but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours together  and as they always see each other in large mixed parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together <EOS> <SOS>  jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention <EOS> <SOS>  when she is secure of him  there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses <EOS> <SOS>    your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married  and if i were determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i should adopt it <EOS> <SOS>  but these are not jane s feelings  she is not acting by design <EOS> <SOS>  as yet  she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard  nor of its reasonableness <EOS> <SOS>  she has known him only a fortnight <EOS> <SOS>  she danced four dances with him at meryton  she saw him one morning at his own house  and has since dined in company with him four times <EOS> <SOS>  this is not quite enough to make her understand his character <EOS> <SOS>    not as you represent it <EOS> <SOS>  had she merely  dined  with him  she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together  and four evenings may do a great deal <EOS> <SOS>    yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce  but with respect to any other leading characteristic  i do not imagine that much has been unfolded <EOS> <SOS>    well   said charlotte   i wish jane success with all my heart  and if she were married to him to morrow  i should think she had as good a chance of happiness  as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth <EOS> <SOS>  happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance <EOS> <SOS>  if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other  or ever so similar before hand  it does not advance their felicity in the least <EOS> <SOS>  they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation  and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life <EOS> <SOS>    you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound <EOS> <SOS>  you know it is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself <EOS> <SOS>   occupied in observing mr bingley s attentions to her sister  elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at her without admiration at the ball  and when they next met  he looked at her only to criticise <EOS> <SOS>  but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes <EOS> <SOS>  to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying <EOS> <SOS>  though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world  he was caught by their easy playfulness <EOS> <SOS>  of this she was perfectly unaware   to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with <EOS> <SOS>  he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards conversing with her himself  attended to her conversation with others <EOS> <SOS>  his doing so drew her notice <EOS> <SOS>  it was at sir william lucas s  where a large party were assembled <EOS> <SOS>   what does mr darcy mean   said she to charlotte   by listening to my conversation with colonel forster <EOS> <SOS>    that is a question which mr darcy only can answer <EOS> <SOS>    but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about <EOS> <SOS>  he has a very satirical eye  and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself  i shall soon grow afraid of him <EOS> <SOS>   on his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming to have any intention of speaking  missucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it  she turned to him and said   did not you think  mr darcy  that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now  when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton <EOS> <SOS>    with great energy   but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic <EOS> <SOS>    you are severe on us <EOS> <SOS>    it will be  her  turn soon to be teazed   said missucas <EOS> <SOS>   i am going to open the instrument  eliza  and you know what follows <EOS> <SOS>    you are a very strange creature by way of a friend <EOS> <SOS>   always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body <EOS> <SOS>   if my vanity had taken a musical turn  you would have been invaluable  but as it is  i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers <EOS> <SOS>   on missucas s persevering  however  she added   very well  if it must be so  it must <EOS> <SOS>   and gravely glancing at mr darcy   there is a fine old saying  which every body here is of course familiar with   keep your breath to cool your porridge    and i shall keep mine to swell my song <EOS> <SOS>   her performance was pleasing  though by no means capital <EOS> <SOS>  after a song or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary  who having  in consequence of being the only plain one in the family  worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments  was always impatient for display <EOS> <SOS>  mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given her application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner  which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  easy and unaffected  had been listened to with much more pleasure  though not playing half so well  and mary  at the end of a long concerto  was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs  at the request of her younger sisters  who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour  till sir william thus began <EOS> <SOS>   what a charming amusement for young people this is  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   there is nothing like dancing after all <EOS> <SOS>   i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies <EOS> <SOS>    certainly  sir   and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world <EOS> <SOS>   every savage can dance <EOS> <SOS>   sir william only smiled <EOS> <SOS>   your friend performs delightfully   he continued after a pause  on seeing bingley join the group    and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    you saw me dance at meryton  i believe  sir <EOS> <SOS>    yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight <EOS> <SOS>  do you often dance at st <EOS> <SOS>  james s <EOS> <SOS>    never  sir <EOS> <SOS>    do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place <EOS> <SOS>    it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it <EOS> <SOS>    you have a house in town  i conclude <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy bowed <EOS> <SOS>   i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself  for i am fond of superior society  but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas <EOS> <SOS>   he paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not disposed to make any  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them  he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing  and called out to her   my dear missliza  why are not you dancing <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy  you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner <EOS> <SOS>   you cannot refuse to dance  i am sure  when so much beauty is before you <EOS> <SOS>   and taking her hand  he would have given it to mr darcy  who  though extremely surprised  was not unwilling to receive it  when she instantly drew back  and said with some discomposure to sir william   indeed  sir  i have not the least intention of dancing <EOS> <SOS>   i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand  but in vain <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was determined  nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion <EOS> <SOS>   you excel so much in the dance  missliza  that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general  he can have no objection  i am sure  to oblige us for one half hour <EOS> <SOS>    mr darcy is all politeness   said elizabeth  smiling <EOS> <SOS>   he is indeed  but considering the inducement  my dear missliza  we cannot wonder at his complaisance  for who would object to such a partner <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth looked archly  and turned away <EOS> <SOS>  her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with some complacency  when thus accosted by missingley   i can guess the subject of your reverie <EOS> <SOS>    i should imagine not <EOS> <SOS>    you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner  in such society  and indeed i am quite of your opinion <EOS> <SOS>  i was never more annoyed <EOS> <SOS>  the insipidity and yet the noise  the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people <EOS> <SOS>   what would i give to hear your strictures on them <EOS> <SOS>    your conjecture is totally wrong  i assure you <EOS> <SOS>  my mind was more agreeably engaged <EOS> <SOS>  i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow <EOS> <SOS>   missingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy replied with great intrepidity   misslizabeth bennet <EOS> <SOS>    misslizabeth bennet <EOS> <SOS>   repeated missingley <EOS> <SOS>   i am all astonishment <EOS> <SOS>  how long has she been such a favourite <EOS> <SOS>   and pray when am i to wish you joy <EOS> <SOS>    that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask <EOS> <SOS>  a lady s imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to love  from love to matrimony in a moment <EOS> <SOS>  i knew you would be wishing me joy <EOS> <SOS>    nay  if you are so serious about it  i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled <EOS> <SOS>  you will have a charming mother in law  indeed  and of course she will be always at pemberley with you <EOS> <SOS>   he listened to her with perfect indifference  while she chose to entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced her that all was safe  her wit flowed long <EOS> <SOS>  chapter vii <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was entailed in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and their mother s fortune  though ample for her situation in life  could but ill supply the deficiency of his <EOS> <SOS>  her father had been an attorney in meryton  and had left her four thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>  she had a sister married to a mr philips  who had been a clerk to their father  and succeeded him in the business  and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade <EOS> <SOS>  the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  a most convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way <EOS> <SOS>  the two youngest of the family  catherine and lydia  were particularly frequent in these attentions  their minds were more vacant than their sisters   and when nothing better offered  a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening  and however bare of news the country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some from their aunt <EOS> <SOS>  at present  indeed  they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter  and meryton was the head quarters <EOS> <SOS>  their visits to mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence <EOS> <SOS>  every day added something to their knowledge of the officers  names and connections <EOS> <SOS>  their lodgings were not long a secret  and at length they began to know the officers themselves <EOS> <SOS>  mr philips visited them all  and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before <EOS> <SOS>  they could talk of nothing but officers  and mr bingley s large fortune  the mention of which gave animation to their mother  was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign <EOS> <SOS>  after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject  mr bennet coolly observed   from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must be two of the silliest girls in the country <EOS> <SOS>  i have suspected it some time  but i am now convinced <EOS> <SOS>   catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but lydia  with perfect indifference  continued to express her admiration of captain carter  and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day  as he was going the next morning to london <EOS> <SOS>   i am astonished  my dear   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   that you should be so ready to think your own children silly <EOS> <SOS>  if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children  it should not be of my own however <EOS> <SOS>    if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it <EOS> <SOS>    yes  but as it happens  they are all of them very clever <EOS> <SOS>    this is the only point  i flatter myself  on which we do not agree <EOS> <SOS>  i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular  but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish <EOS> <SOS>    my dear mr bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother <EOS> <SOS>   when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do <EOS> <SOS>  i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well  and indeed so i do still at my heart  and if a smart young colonel  with five or six thousand a year  should want one of my girls  i shall not say nay to him  and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals <EOS> <SOS>    mama   cried lydia   my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to missatson s as they did when they first came  she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for missennet  it came from netherfield  and the servant waited for an answer <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure  and she was eagerly calling out  while her daughter read   well  jane  who is it from <EOS> <SOS>  what is it about <EOS> <SOS>  what does he say <EOS> <SOS>  well  jane  make haste and tell us  make haste  my love <EOS> <SOS>    it is from missingley   said jane  and then read it aloud <EOS> <SOS>        my dear friend        if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and      me  we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives  for a whole day s t te   t te between two women can never      end without a quarrel <EOS> <SOS>  come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this <EOS> <SOS>  my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers <EOS> <SOS>       yours ever        caroline bingley <EOS> <SOS>    with the officers <EOS> <SOS>   cried lydia <EOS> <SOS>   i wonder my aunt did not tell us of  that  <EOS> <SOS>    dining out   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   that is very unlucky <EOS> <SOS>    can i have the carriage <EOS> <SOS>   said jane <EOS> <SOS>   no  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems likely to rain  and then you must stay all night <EOS> <SOS>    that would be a good scheme   said elizabeth   if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  but the gentlemen will have mr bingley s chaise to go to meryton  and the hursts have no horses to theirs <EOS> <SOS>    i had much rather go in the coach <EOS> <SOS>    but  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  i am sure <EOS> <SOS>  they are wanted in the farm  mr bennet  are not they <EOS> <SOS>    they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them <EOS> <SOS>    but if you have got them to day   said elizabeth   my mother s purpose will be answered <EOS> <SOS>   she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged <EOS> <SOS>  jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback  and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day <EOS> <SOS>  her hopes were answered  jane had not been gone long before it rained hard <EOS> <SOS>  her sisters were uneasy for her  but her mother was delighted <EOS> <SOS>  the rain continued the whole evening without intermission  jane certainly could not come back <EOS> <SOS>   this was a lucky idea of mine  indeed <EOS> <SOS>   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  more than once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own <EOS> <SOS>  till the next morning  however  she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance <EOS> <SOS>  breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth        my dearest lizzy        i find myself very unwell this morning  which  i suppose  is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday <EOS> <SOS>  my kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till i am better <EOS> <SOS>  they insist also on      my seeing mr jones  therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me  and excepting a sore throat and head ache      there is not much the matter with me <EOS> <SOS>        yours   c <EOS> <SOS>    well  my dear   said mr bennet  when elizabeth had read the note aloud   if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness  if she should die  it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley  and under your orders <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  i am not at all afraid of her dying <EOS> <SOS>  people do not die of little trifling colds <EOS> <SOS>  she will be taken good care of <EOS> <SOS>  as long as she stays there  it is all very well <EOS> <SOS>  i would go and see her  if i could have the carriage <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her  though the carriage was not to be had  and as she was no horse woman  walking was her only alternative <EOS> <SOS>  she declared her resolution <EOS> <SOS>   how can you be so silly   cried her mother   as to think of such a thing  in all this dirt <EOS> <SOS>  you will not be fit to be seen when you get there <EOS> <SOS>    i shall be very fit to see jane  which is all i want <EOS> <SOS>    is this a hint to me  lizzy   said her father   to send for the horses <EOS> <SOS>    no  indeed <EOS> <SOS>  i do not wish to avoid the walk <EOS> <SOS>  the distance is nothing  when one has a motive  only three miles <EOS> <SOS>  i shall be back by dinner <EOS> <SOS>    i admire the activity of your benevolence   observed mary   but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my opinion  exertion should always be in proportion to what is required <EOS> <SOS>    we will go as far as meryton with you   said catherine and lydia <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young ladies set off together <EOS> <SOS>   if we make haste   said lydia  as they walked along   perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes <EOS> <SOS>   in meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers  wives  and elizabeth continued her walk alone  crossing field after field at a quick pace  jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity  and finding herself at last within view of the house  with weary ancles  dirty stockings  and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise <EOS> <SOS>  she was shewn into the breakfast parlour  where all but jane were assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise <EOS> <SOS>   that she should have walked three miles so early in the day  in such dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible to mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it <EOS> <SOS>  she was received  however  very politely by them  and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness  there was good humour and kindness <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy said very little  and mr hurst nothing at all <EOS> <SOS>  the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone <EOS> <SOS>  the latter was thinking only of his breakfast <EOS> <SOS>  her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered <EOS> <SOS>  missennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately  and jane  who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience  from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit  was delighted at her entrance <EOS> <SOS>  she was not equal  however  to much conversation  and when missingley left them together  could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth silently attended her <EOS> <SOS>  when breakfast was over  they were joined by the sisters  and elizabeth began to like them herself  when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane <EOS> <SOS>  the apothecary came  and having examined his patient  said  as might be supposed  that she had caught a violent cold  and that they must endeavour to get the better of it  advised her to return to bed  and promised her some draughts <EOS> <SOS>  the advice was followed readily  for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head ached acutely <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were the other ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere <EOS> <SOS>  when the clock struck three  elizabeth felt that she must go  and very unwillingly said so <EOS> <SOS>  missingley offered her the carriage  and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it  when jane testified such concern in parting with her  that missingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth most thankfully consented  and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay  and bring back a supply of clothes <EOS> <SOS>  chapter viii <EOS> <SOS>  at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner <EOS> <SOS>  to the civil enquiries which then poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley s  she could not make a very favourable answer <EOS> <SOS>  jane was by no means better <EOS> <SOS>  the sisters  on hearing this  repeated three or four times how much they were grieved  how shocking it was to have a bad cold  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves  and then thought no more of the matter  and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them  restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike <EOS> <SOS>  their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency <EOS> <SOS>  his anxiety for jane was evident  and his attentions to herself most pleasing  and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others <EOS> <SOS>  she had very little notice from any but him <EOS> <SOS>  missingley was engrossed by mr darcy  her sister scarcely less so  and as for mr hurst  by whom elizabeth sat  he was an indolent man  who lived only to eat  drink  and play at cards  who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout  had nothing to say to her <EOS> <SOS>  when dinner was over  she returned directly to jane  and missingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room <EOS> <SOS>  her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride and impertinence  she had no conversation  no style  no taste  no beauty <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst thought the same  and added   she has nothing  in short  to recommend her  but being an excellent walker <EOS> <SOS>  i shall never forget her appearance this morning <EOS> <SOS>  she really looked almost wild <EOS> <SOS>    she did indeed  louisa <EOS> <SOS>  i could hardly keep my countenance <EOS> <SOS>  very nonsensical to come at all <EOS> <SOS>  why must  she  be scampering about the country  because her sister had a cold <EOS> <SOS>  her hair so untidy  so blowsy <EOS> <SOS>    yes  and her petticoat  i hope you saw her petticoat  six inches deep in mud  i am absolutely certain  and the gown which had been let down to hide it  not doing its office <EOS> <SOS>    your picture may be very exact  louisa   said bingley   but this was all lost upon me <EOS> <SOS>  i thought misslizabeth bennet looked remarkably well  when she came into the room this morning <EOS> <SOS>  her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice <EOS> <SOS>     you  observed it  mr darcy  i am sure   said missingley   and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your sister  make such an exhibition <EOS> <SOS>    certainly not <EOS> <SOS>    to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever it is  above her ancles in dirt  and alone  quite alone <EOS> <SOS>  what could she mean by it <EOS> <SOS>  it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence  a most country town indifference to decorum <EOS> <SOS>    it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing   said bingley <EOS> <SOS>   i am afraid  mr darcy   observed missingley  in a half whisper   that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes <EOS> <SOS>    not at all   he replied   they were brightened by the exercise <EOS> <SOS>    a short pause followed this speech  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst began again <EOS> <SOS>   i have an excessive regard for jane bennet  she is really a very sweet girl  and i wish with all my heart she were well settled <EOS> <SOS>  but with such a father and mother  and such low connections  i am afraid there is no chance of it <EOS> <SOS>    i think i have heard you say  that their uncle is an attorney in meryton <EOS> <SOS>    yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside <EOS> <SOS>    that is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed heartily <EOS> <SOS>   if they had uncles enough to fill  all  cheapside   cried bingley   it would not make them one jot less agreeable <EOS> <SOS>    but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world   replied darcy <EOS> <SOS>  to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations <EOS> <SOS>  with a renewal of tenderness  however  they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour  and sat with her till summoned to coffee <EOS> <SOS>  she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep  and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself <EOS> <SOS>  on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo  and was immediately invited to join them  but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse  said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book <EOS> <SOS>  mr hurst looked at her with astonishment <EOS> <SOS>   do you prefer reading to cards <EOS> <SOS>   said he   that is rather singular <EOS> <SOS>    missliza bennet   said missingley   despises cards <EOS> <SOS>  she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else <EOS> <SOS>    i deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried elizabeth   i am  not  a great reader  and i have pleasure in many things <EOS> <SOS>    in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure   said bingley   and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying <EOS> <SOS>  he immediately offered to fetch her others  all that his library afforded <EOS> <SOS>   and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit  but i am an idle fellow  and though i have not many  i have more than i ever look into <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room <EOS> <SOS>   i am astonished   said missingley   that my father should have left so small a collection of books <EOS> <SOS>   what a delightful library you have at pemberley  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    it ought to be good   he replied   it has been the work of many generations <EOS> <SOS>    and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always buying books <EOS> <SOS>    i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these <EOS> <SOS>    neglect <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place <EOS> <SOS>  charles  when you build  your  house  i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley <EOS> <SOS>    i wish it may <EOS> <SOS>    but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood  and take pemberley for a kind of model <EOS> <SOS>  there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire <EOS> <SOS>    with all my heart  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it <EOS> <SOS>    i am talking of possibilities  charles <EOS> <SOS>    upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was so much caught by what passed  as to leave her very little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly aside  she drew near the card table  and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game <EOS> <SOS>   is missarcy much grown since the spring <EOS> <SOS>   said missingley   will she be as tall as i am <EOS> <SOS>    i think she will <EOS> <SOS>  she is now about misslizabeth bennet s height  or rather taller <EOS> <SOS>    how i long to see her again <EOS> <SOS>  i never met with anybody who delighted me so much <EOS> <SOS>  such a countenance  such manners <EOS> <SOS>  and so extremely accomplished for her age <EOS> <SOS>  her performance on the piano forte is exquisite <EOS> <SOS>    it is amazing to me   said bingley   how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished  as they all are <EOS> <SOS>    all young ladies accomplished <EOS> <SOS>  my dear charles  what do you mean <EOS> <SOS>    yes  all of them  i think <EOS> <SOS>  they all paint tables  cover skreens and net purses <EOS> <SOS>  i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this  and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time  without being informed that she was very accomplished <EOS> <SOS>    your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said darcy   has too much truth <EOS> <SOS>  the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse  or covering a skreen <EOS> <SOS>  but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen  in the whole range of my acquaintance  that are really accomplished <EOS> <SOS>    nor i  i am sure   said missingley <EOS> <SOS>   then   observed elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman <EOS> <SOS>    yes  i do comprehend a great deal in it <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  certainly   cried his faithful assistant   no one can be really esteemed accomplished  who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with <EOS> <SOS>  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music  singing  drawing  dancing  and the modern languages  to deserve the word  and besides all this  she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking  the tone of her voice  her address and expressions  or the word will be but half deserved <EOS> <SOS>    all this she must possess   added darcy   and to all this she must yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading <EOS> <SOS>    i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished women <EOS> <SOS>  i rather wonder now at your knowing  any  <EOS> <SOS>    are you so severe upon your own sex  as to doubt the possibility of all this <EOS> <SOS>     i  never saw such a woman <EOS> <SOS>   i  never saw such capacity  and taste  and application  and elegance  as you describe  united <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description  when mr hurst called them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward <EOS> <SOS>  as all conversation was thereby at an end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the room <EOS> <SOS>   eliza bennet   said missingley  when the door was closed on her   is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex  by undervaluing their own  and with many men  i dare say  it succeeds <EOS> <SOS>  but  in my opinion  it is a paltry device  a very mean art <EOS> <SOS>    undoubtedly   replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly addressed   there is meanness in  all  the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation <EOS> <SOS>  whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable <EOS> <SOS>   missingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse  and that she could not leave her <EOS> <SOS>  bingley urged mr jones s being sent for immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians <EOS> <SOS>  this  she would not hear of  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal  and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning  if missennet were not decidedly better <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters declared that they were miserable <EOS> <SOS>  they solaced their wretchedness  however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister <EOS> <SOS>  chapter ix <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters <EOS> <SOS>  in spite of this amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her own judgment of her situation <EOS> <SOS>  the note was immediately dispatched  and its contents as quickly complied with <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast <EOS> <SOS>  had she found jane in any apparent danger  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet would have been very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home  neither did the apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all advisable <EOS> <SOS>  after sitting a little while with jane  on missingley s appearance and invitation  the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour <EOS> <SOS>  bingley met them with hopes that mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had not found missennet worse than she expected <EOS> <SOS>   indeed i have  sir   was her answer <EOS> <SOS>   she is a great deal too ill to be moved <EOS> <SOS>  mr jones says we must not think of moving her <EOS> <SOS>  we must trespass a little longer on your kindness <EOS> <SOS>    removed <EOS> <SOS>   cried bingley <EOS> <SOS>   it must not be thought of <EOS> <SOS>  my sister  i am sure  will not hear of her removal <EOS> <SOS>    you may depend upon it  madam   said missingley  with cold civility   that missennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments <EOS> <SOS>   i am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed  and suffers a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the world  which is always the way with her  for she has  without exception  the sweetest temper i ever met with <EOS> <SOS>  i often tell my other girls they are nothing to  her  <EOS> <SOS>  you have a sweet room here  mr bingley  and a charming prospect over that gravel walk <EOS> <SOS>  i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope  though you have but a short lease <EOS> <SOS>    whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in five minutes <EOS> <SOS>  at present  however  i consider myself as quite fixed here <EOS> <SOS>    that is exactly what i should have supposed of you   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   you begin to comprehend me  do you <EOS> <SOS>   cried he  turning towards her <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  yes  i understand you perfectly <EOS> <SOS>    i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful <EOS> <SOS>    that is as it happens <EOS> <SOS>  it does not necessarily follow that a deep  intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours <EOS> <SOS>    lizzy   cried her mother   remember where you are  and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home <EOS> <SOS>    i did not know before   continued bingley immediately   that you were a studier of character <EOS> <SOS>  it must be an amusing study <EOS> <SOS>    yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing <EOS> <SOS>  they have at least that advantage <EOS> <SOS>    the country   said darcy   can in general supply but few subjects for such a study <EOS> <SOS>  in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society <EOS> <SOS>    but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new to be observed in them for ever <EOS> <SOS>    yes  indeed   cried mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood <EOS> <SOS>   i assure you there is quite as much of  that  going on in the country as in town <EOS> <SOS>   every body was surprised  and darcy  after looking at her for a moment  turned silently away <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him  continued her triumph <EOS> <SOS>   i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part  except the shops and public places <EOS> <SOS>  the country is a vast deal pleasanter  is not it  mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>    when i am in the country   he replied   i never wish to leave it  and when i am in town it is pretty much the same <EOS> <SOS>  they have each their advantages  and i can be equally happy in either <EOS> <SOS>    aye  that is because you have the right disposition <EOS> <SOS>  but that gentleman   looking at darcy   seemed to think the country was nothing at all <EOS> <SOS>    indeed  mama  you are mistaken   said elizabeth  blushing for her mother <EOS> <SOS>   you quite mistook mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town  which you must acknowledge to be true <EOS> <SOS>    certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood  i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger <EOS> <SOS>  i know we dine with four and twenty families <EOS> <SOS>   nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance <EOS> <SOS>  his sister was less delicate  and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts  now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since  her  coming away <EOS> <SOS>   yes  she called yesterday with her father <EOS> <SOS>  what an agreeable man sir william is  mr bingley  is not he <EOS> <SOS>  so much the man of fashion <EOS> <SOS>  so genteel and so easy <EOS> <SOS>   he has always something to say to every body <EOS> <SOS>    that  is my idea of good breeding  and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths  quite mistake the matter <EOS> <SOS>    did charlotte dine with you <EOS> <SOS>    no  she would go home <EOS> <SOS>  i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies <EOS> <SOS>  for my part  mr bingley   i  always keep servants that can do their own work   my  daughters are brought up differently <EOS> <SOS>  but every body is to judge for themselves  and the lucases are very good sort of girls  i assure you <EOS> <SOS>  it is a pity they are not handsome <EOS> <SOS>  not that  i  think charlotte so  very  plain  but then she is our particular friend <EOS> <SOS>    she seems a very pleasant young woman   said bingley <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  dear  yes   but you must own she is very plain <EOS> <SOS>  lady lucas herself has often said so  and envied me jane s beauty <EOS> <SOS>  i do not like to boast of my own child  but to be sure  jane  one does not often see any body better looking <EOS> <SOS>  it is what every body says <EOS> <SOS>  i do not trust my own partiality <EOS> <SOS>  when she was only fifteen  there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town  so much in love with her  that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away <EOS> <SOS>  but however he did not <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps he thought her too young <EOS> <SOS>  however  he wrote some verses on her  and very pretty they were <EOS> <SOS>    and so ended his affection   said elizabeth impatiently <EOS> <SOS>   there has been many a one  i fancy  overcome in the same way <EOS> <SOS>  i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love <EOS> <SOS>    i have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love   said darcy <EOS> <SOS>   of a fine  stout  healthy love it may <EOS> <SOS>  every thing nourishes what is strong already <EOS> <SOS>  but if it be only a slight  thin sort of inclination  i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away <EOS> <SOS>   darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again <EOS> <SOS>  she longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say  and after a short silence mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane  with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be civil also  and say what the occasion required <EOS> <SOS>  she performed her part indeed without much graciousness  but mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was satisfied  and soon afterwards ordered her carriage <EOS> <SOS>  upon this signal  the youngest of her daughters put herself forward <EOS> <SOS>  the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit  and the result of it was  that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  lydia was a stout  well grown girl of fifteen  with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance  a favourite with her mother  whose affection had brought her into public at an early age <EOS> <SOS>  she had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural self consequence  which the attentions of the officers  to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her  had increased into assurance <EOS> <SOS>  she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball  and abruptly reminded him of his promise  adding  that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it <EOS> <SOS>  his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear <EOS> <SOS>   i am perfectly ready  i assure you  to keep my engagement  and when your sister is recovered  you shall if you please name the very day of the ball <EOS> <SOS>  but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill <EOS> <SOS>   lydia declared herself satisfied <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  yes  it would be much better to wait till jane was well  and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again <EOS> <SOS>  and when you have given  your  ball   she added   i shall insist on their giving one also <EOS> <SOS>  i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and her daughters then departed  and elizabeth returned instantly to jane  leaving her own and her relations  behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy  the latter of whom  however  could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her   in spite of all missingley s witticisms on  fine eyes  <EOS> <SOS>  chapter x <EOS> <SOS>  the day passed much as the day before had done <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid  who continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room <EOS> <SOS>  the loo table  however  did not appear <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy was writing  and missingley  seated near him  was watching the progress of his letter  and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister <EOS> <SOS>  mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst was observing their game <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion <EOS> <SOS>  the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing  or on the evenness of his lines  or on the length of his letter  with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received  formed a curious dialogue  and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each <EOS> <SOS>   how delighted missarcy will be to receive such a letter <EOS> <SOS>   he made no answer <EOS> <SOS>   you write uncommonly fast <EOS> <SOS>    you are mistaken <EOS> <SOS>  i write rather slowly <EOS> <SOS>    how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year <EOS> <SOS>  letters of business too <EOS> <SOS>  how odious i should think them <EOS> <SOS>    it is fortunate  then  that they fall to my lot instead of to yours <EOS> <SOS>    pray tell your sister that i long to see her <EOS> <SOS>    i have already told her so once  by your desire <EOS> <SOS>    i am afraid you do not like your pen <EOS> <SOS>  let me mend it for you <EOS> <SOS>  i mend pens remarkably well <EOS> <SOS>    thank you  but i always mend my own <EOS> <SOS>    how can you contrive to write so even <EOS> <SOS>   he was silent <EOS> <SOS>   tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp  and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table  and i think it infinitely superior to missrantley s <EOS> <SOS>    will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again <EOS> <SOS>   at present i have not room to do them justice <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  it is of no consequence <EOS> <SOS>  i shall see her in january <EOS> <SOS>  but do you always write such charming long letters to her  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    they are generally long  but whether always charming  it is not for me to determine <EOS> <SOS>    it is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter  with ease  cannot write ill <EOS> <SOS>    that will not do for a compliment to darcy  caroline   cried her brother   because he does  not  write with ease <EOS> <SOS>  he studies too much for words of four syllables <EOS> <SOS>   do not you  darcy <EOS> <SOS>    my style of writing is very different from yours <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>   cried missingley   charles writes in the most careless way imaginable <EOS> <SOS>  he leaves out half his words  and blots the rest <EOS> <SOS>    my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them  by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents <EOS> <SOS>    your humility  mr bingley   said elizabeth   must disarm reproof <EOS> <SOS>    nothing is more deceitful   said darcy   than the appearance of humility <EOS> <SOS>  it is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes an indirect boast <EOS> <SOS>    and which of the two do you call  my  little recent piece of modesty <EOS> <SOS>    the indirect boast   for you are really proud of your defects in writing  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution  which if not estimable  you think at least highly interesting <EOS> <SOS>  the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor  and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance <EOS> <SOS>  when you told mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric  of compliment to yourself  and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone  and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <EOS> <SOS>    nay   cried bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning <EOS> <SOS>  and yet  upon my honour  i believed what i said of myself to be true  and i believe it at this moment <EOS> <SOS>  at least  therefore  i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies <EOS> <SOS>    i dare say you believed it  but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity <EOS> <SOS>  your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know  and if  as you were mounting your horse  a friend were to say   bingley  you had better stay till next week   you would probably do it  you would probably not go  and  at another word  might stay a month <EOS> <SOS>    you have only proved by this   cried elizabeth   that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition <EOS> <SOS>  you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself <EOS> <SOS>    i am exceedingly gratified   said bingley   by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper <EOS> <SOS>  but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend  for he would certainly think the better of me  if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial  and ride off as fast as i could <EOS> <SOS>    would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it <EOS> <SOS>    upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must speak for himself <EOS> <SOS>    you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine  but which i have never acknowledged <EOS> <SOS>  allowing the case  however  to stand according to your representation  you must remember  missennet  that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house  and the delay of his plan  has merely desired it  asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety <EOS> <SOS>    to yield readily  easily  to the  persuasion  of a friend is no merit with you <EOS> <SOS>    to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either <EOS> <SOS>    you appear to me  mr darcy  to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection <EOS> <SOS>  a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request  without waiting for arguments to reason one into it <EOS> <SOS>  i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>  we may as well wait  perhaps  till the circumstance occurs  before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon <EOS> <SOS>  but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend  where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment  should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire  without waiting to be argued into it <EOS> <SOS>    will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request  as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties <EOS> <SOS>    by all means   cried bingley   let us hear all the particulars  not forgetting their comparative height and size  for that will have more weight in the argument  missennet  than you may be aware of <EOS> <SOS>  i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow  in comparison with myself  i should not pay him half so much deference <EOS> <SOS>  i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy  on particular occasions  and in particular places  at his own house especially  and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy smiled  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh <EOS> <SOS>  missingley warmly resented the indignity he had received  in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense <EOS> <SOS>   i see your design  bingley   said his friend <EOS> <SOS>    you dislike an argument  and want to silence this <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps i do <EOS> <SOS>  arguments are too much like disputes <EOS> <SOS>  if you and missennet will defer yours till i am out of the room  i shall be very thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me <EOS> <SOS>    what you ask   said elizabeth   is no sacrifice on my side  and mr darcy had much better finish his letter <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter <EOS> <SOS>  when that business was over  he applied to missingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music <EOS> <SOS>  missingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte  and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way  which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived  she seated herself <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr darcy s eyes were fixed on her <EOS> <SOS>  she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still more strange <EOS> <SOS>  she could only imagine however at last  that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in any other person present <EOS> <SOS>  the supposition did not pain her <EOS> <SOS>  she liked him too little to care for his approbation <EOS> <SOS>  after playing some italian songs  missingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air  and soon afterwards mr darcy  drawing near elizabeth  said to her    do not you feel a great inclination  missennet  to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel <EOS> <SOS>   she smiled  but made no answer <EOS> <SOS>  he repeated the question  with some surprise at her silence <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>   said she   i heard you before  but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply <EOS> <SOS>  you wanted me  i know  to say  yes   that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste  but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt <EOS> <SOS>  i have therefore made up my mind to tell you  that i do not want to dance a reel at all  and now despise me if you dare <EOS> <SOS>    indeed i do not dare <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at his gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody  and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her <EOS> <SOS>  he really believed  that were it not for the inferiority of her connections  he should be in some danger <EOS> <SOS>  missingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane  received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest  by talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in such an alliance <EOS> <SOS>   i hope   said she  as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day   you will give your mother in law a few hints  when this desirable event takes place  as to the advantage of holding her tongue  and if you can compass it  do cure the younger girls of running after the officers <EOS> <SOS>   and  if i may mention so delicate a subject  endeavour to check that little something  bordering on conceit and impertinence  which your lady possesses <EOS> <SOS>    have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  yes <EOS> <SOS>   do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley <EOS> <SOS>  put them next to your great uncle the judge <EOS> <SOS>  they are in the same profession  you know  only in different lines <EOS> <SOS>  as for your elizabeth s picture  you must not attempt to have it taken  for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes <EOS> <SOS>    it would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but their colour and shape  and the eye lashes  so remarkably fine  might be copied <EOS> <SOS>   at that moment they were met from another walk  by mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and elizabeth herself <EOS> <SOS>   i did not know that you intended to walk   said missingley  in some confusion  lest they had been overheard <EOS> <SOS>   you used us abominably ill   answered mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst   in running away without telling us that you were coming out <EOS> <SOS>   then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy  she left elizabeth to walk by herself <EOS> <SOS>  the path just admitted three <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said     this walk is not wide enough for our party <EOS> <SOS>  we had better go into the avenue <EOS> <SOS>   but elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with them  laughingly answered   no  no  stay where you are <EOS> <SOS>   you are charmingly group d  and appear to uncommon advantage <EOS> <SOS>  the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth <EOS> <SOS>  good bye <EOS> <SOS>   she then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the hope of being at home again in a day or two <EOS> <SOS>  jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xi <EOS> <SOS>  when the ladies removed after dinner  elizabeth ran up to her sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into the drawing room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared <EOS> <SOS>  their powers of conversation were considerable <EOS> <SOS>  they could describe an entertainment with accuracy  relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit <EOS> <SOS>  but when the gentlemen entered  jane was no longer the first object <EOS> <SOS>  missingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy  and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps <EOS> <SOS>  he addressed himself directly to missennet  with a polite congratulation  mr hurst also made her a slight bow  and said he was  very glad   but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation <EOS> <SOS>  he was full of joy and attention <EOS> <SOS>  the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she should suffer from the change of room  and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place  that she might be farther from the door <EOS> <SOS>  he then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to any one else <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with great delight <EOS> <SOS>  when tea was over  mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table  but in vain <EOS> <SOS>  she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards  and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected <EOS> <SOS>  she assured him that no one intended to play  and the silence of the whole party on the subject  seemed to justify her <EOS> <SOS>  mr hurst had therefore nothing to do  but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep <EOS> <SOS>  darcy took up a book  missingley did the same  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst  principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings  joined now and then in her brother s conversation with missennet <EOS> <SOS>  missingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy s progress through  his  book  as in reading her own  and she was perpetually either making some inquiry  or looking at his page <EOS> <SOS>  she could not win him  however  to any conversation  he merely answered her question  and read on <EOS> <SOS>  at length  quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book  which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his  she gave a great yawn and said   how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way <EOS> <SOS>  i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading <EOS> <SOS>  how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book <EOS> <SOS>   when i have a house of my own  i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library <EOS> <SOS>   no one made any reply <EOS> <SOS>  she then yawned again  threw aside her book  and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement  when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to missennet  she turned suddenly towards him and said   by the bye  charles  are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>   i would advise you  before you determine on it  to consult the wishes of the present party  i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure <EOS> <SOS>    if you mean darcy   cried her brother   he may go to bed  if he chuses  before it begins  but as for the ball  it is quite a settled thing  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards <EOS> <SOS>    i should like balls infinitely better   she replied   if they were carried on in a different manner  but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting <EOS> <SOS>  it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day <EOS> <SOS>    much more rational  my dear caroline  i dare say  but it would not be near so much like a ball <EOS> <SOS>   missingley made no answer  and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room <EOS> <SOS>  her figure was elegant  and she walked well   but darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly studious <EOS> <SOS>  in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more  and  turning to elizabeth  said   missliza bennet  let me persuade you to follow my example  and take a turn about the room <EOS> <SOS>   i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately <EOS> <SOS>  missingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  mr darcy looked up <EOS> <SOS>  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously closed his book <EOS> <SOS>  he was directly invited to join their party  but he declined it  observing  that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together  with either of which motives his joining them would interfere <EOS> <SOS>   what could he mean <EOS> <SOS>  she was dying to know what could be his meaning   and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him <EOS> <SOS>   not at all   was her answer   but depend upon it  he means to be severe on us  and our surest way of disappointing him  will be to ask nothing about it <EOS> <SOS>   missingley  however  was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives <EOS> <SOS>   i have not the smallest objection to explaining them   said he  as soon as she allowed him to speak <EOS> <SOS>   you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss  or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking   if the first  i should be completely in your way   and if the second  i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  shocking <EOS> <SOS>   cried missingley <EOS> <SOS>   i never heard any thing so abominable <EOS> <SOS>  how shall we punish him for such a speech <EOS> <SOS>    nothing so easy  if you have but the inclination   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   we can all plague and punish one another <EOS> <SOS>  teaze him  laugh at him <EOS> <SOS>   intimate as you are  you must know how it is to be done <EOS> <SOS>    but upon my honour i do  not  <EOS> <SOS>  i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me  that  <EOS> <SOS>  teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind <EOS> <SOS>  no  no  i feel he may defy us there <EOS> <SOS>  and as to laughter  we will not expose ourselves  if you please  by attempting to laugh without a subject <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy may hug himself <EOS> <SOS>    mr darcy is not to be laughed at <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   that is an uncommon advantage  and uncommon i hope it will continue  for it would be a great loss to  me  to have many such acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  i dearly love a laugh <EOS> <SOS>    missingley   said he   has given me credit for more than can be <EOS> <SOS>  the wisest and the best of men  nay  the wisest and best of their actions  may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke <EOS> <SOS>    certainly   replied elizabeth   there are such people  but i hope i am not one of  them  <EOS> <SOS>  i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good <EOS> <SOS>  follies and nonsense  whims and inconsistencies  do  divert me  i own  and i laugh at them whenever i can <EOS> <SOS>   but these  i suppose  are precisely what you are without <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps that is not possible for any one <EOS> <SOS>  but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule <EOS> <SOS>    such as vanity and pride <EOS> <SOS>    yes  vanity is a weakness indeed <EOS> <SOS>  but pride  where there is a real superiority of mind  pride will be always under good regulation <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth turned away to hide a smile <EOS> <SOS>   your examination of mr darcy is over  i presume   said missingley    and pray what is the result <EOS> <SOS>    i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect <EOS> <SOS>  he owns it himself without disguise <EOS> <SOS>    no   said darcy   i have made no such pretension <EOS> <SOS>  i have faults enough  but they are not  i hope  of understanding <EOS> <SOS>  my temper i dare not vouch for <EOS> <SOS>   it is i believe too little yielding  certainly too little for the convenience of the world <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought  nor their offences against myself <EOS> <SOS>  my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them <EOS> <SOS>  my temper would perhaps be called resentful <EOS> <SOS>   my good opinion once lost is lost for ever <EOS> <SOS>     that  is a failing indeed <EOS> <SOS>    cried elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   implacable resentment  is  a shade in a character <EOS> <SOS>  but you have chosen your fault well <EOS> <SOS>   i really cannot  laugh  at it <EOS> <SOS>  you are safe from me <EOS> <SOS>    there is  i believe  in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil  a natural defect  which not even the best education can overcome <EOS> <SOS>    and  your  defect is a propensity to hate every body <EOS> <SOS>    and yours   he replied with a smile   is wilfully to misunderstand them <EOS> <SOS>    do let us have a little music    cried missingley  tired of a conversation in which she had no share <EOS> <SOS>    louisa  you will not mind my waking mr hurst <EOS> <SOS>   her sister made not the smallest objection  and the piano forte was opened  and darcy  after a few moments recollection  was not sorry for it <EOS> <SOS>  he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xii <EOS> <SOS>  in consequence of an agreement between the sisters  elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother  to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day <EOS> <SOS>  but mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday  which would exactly finish jane s week  could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before <EOS> <SOS>  her answer  therefore  was not propitious  at least not to elizabeth s wishes  for she was impatient to get home <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday  and in her postscript it was added  that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she could spare them very well <EOS> <SOS>   against staying longer  however  elizabeth was positively resolved  nor did she much expect it would be asked  and fearful  on the contrary  as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long  she urged jane to borrow mr bingley s carriage immediately  and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned  and the request made <EOS> <SOS>  the communication excited many professions of concern  and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane  and till the morrow  their going was deferred <EOS> <SOS>  missingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other <EOS> <SOS>  the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade missennet that it would not be safe for her  that she was not enough recovered  but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right <EOS> <SOS>  to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence  elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough <EOS> <SOS>  she attracted him more than he liked  and missingley was uncivil to  her   and more teazing than usual to himself <EOS> <SOS>  he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should  now  escape him  nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity  sensible that if such an idea had been suggested  his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it <EOS> <SOS>  steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday  and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour  he adhered most conscientiously to his book  and would not even look at her <EOS> <SOS>  on sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to almost all  took place <EOS> <SOS>  missingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly  as well as her affection for jane  and when they parted  after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield  and embracing her most tenderly  she even shook hands with the former <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits <EOS> <SOS>  they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble  and was sure jane would have caught cold again <EOS> <SOS>   but their father  though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure  was really glad to see them  he had felt their importance in the family circle <EOS> <SOS>  the evening conversation  when they were all assembled  had lost much of its animation  and almost all its sense  by the absence of jane and elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  they found mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature  and had some new extracts to admire  and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to <EOS> <SOS>  catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort <EOS> <SOS>  much had been done  and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday  several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle  a private had been flogged  and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xiii <EOS> <SOS>   i hope  my dear   said mr bennet to his wife  as they were at breakfast the next morning   that you have ordered a good dinner to day  because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party <EOS> <SOS>    who do you mean  my dear <EOS> <SOS>  i know of nobody that is coming i am sure  unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in  and i hope  my  dinners are good enough for her <EOS> <SOS>  i do not believe she often sees such at home <EOS> <SOS>    the person of whom i speak  is a gentleman and a stranger <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s eyes sparkled <EOS> <SOS>    a gentleman and a stranger <EOS> <SOS>  it is mr bingley i am sure <EOS> <SOS>  why jane  you never dropt a word of this  you sly thing <EOS> <SOS>  well  i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>   but  good lord <EOS> <SOS>  how unlucky <EOS> <SOS>  there is not a bit of fish to be got to day <EOS> <SOS>  lydia  my love  ring the bell <EOS> <SOS>  i must speak to hill  this moment <EOS> <SOS>    it is  not  mr bingley   said her husband   it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life <EOS> <SOS>   this roused a general astonishment  and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once <EOS> <SOS>  after amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus explained <EOS> <SOS>   about a month ago i received this letter  and about a fortnight ago i answered it  for i thought it a case of some delicacy  and requiring early attention <EOS> <SOS>  it is from my cousin  mr collins  who  when i am dead  may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear   cried his wife   i cannot bear to hear that mentioned <EOS> <SOS>  pray do not talk of that odious man <EOS> <SOS>  i do think it is the hardest thing in the world  that your estate should be entailed away from your own children  and i am sure if i had been you  i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it <EOS> <SOS>   jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail <EOS> <SOS>  they had often attempted it before  but it was a subject on which mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters  in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about <EOS> <SOS>   it certainly is a most iniquitous affair   said mr bennet   and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  but if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself <EOS> <SOS>    no  that i am sure i shall not  and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical <EOS> <SOS>  i hate such false friends <EOS> <SOS>  why could not he keep on quarrelling with you  as his father did before him <EOS> <SOS>    why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head  as you will hear <EOS> <SOS>         hunsford  near westerham  kent       15th october <EOS> <SOS>        dear sir       the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured      father  always gave me much uneasiness  and since i have had the      misfortune to lose him  i have frequently wished to heal the      breach  but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts  fearing      lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good      terms with any one  with whom it had always pleased him to be at      variance <EOS> <SOS>    there  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>    my mind however is now made up on      the subject  for having received ordination at easter  i have been      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right      honourable lady catherine de bourgh  widow of sir lewis de bourgh       whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable      rectory of this parish  where it shall be my earnest endeavour to      demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship  and be      ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are      instituted by the church of england <EOS> <SOS>  as a clergyman  moreover  i      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence  and on these grounds      i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly      commendable  and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of longbourn estate  will be kindly overlooked on your side       and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for it  as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends   but      of this hereafter <EOS> <SOS>  if you should have no objection to receive me      into your house  i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family  monday  november 18th  by four o clock  and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday      se night following  which i can do without any inconvenience  as      lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      sunday  provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day <EOS> <SOS>  i remain  dear sir  with respectful compliments to      your lady and daughters  your well wisher and friend       william collins <EOS> <SOS>    at four o clock  therefore  we may expect this peace making gentleman   said mr bennet  as he folded up the letter <EOS> <SOS>   he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man  upon my word  and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance  especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again <EOS> <SOS>    there is some sense in what he says about the girls however  and if he is disposed to make them any amends  i shall not be the person to discourage him <EOS> <SOS>    though it is difficult   said jane   to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is certainly to his credit <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying  and burying his parishioners whenever it were required <EOS> <SOS>   he must be an oddity  i think   said she <EOS> <SOS>   i cannot make him out <EOS> <SOS>   there is something very pompous in his style <EOS> <SOS>   and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail <EOS> <SOS>   we cannot suppose he would help it  if he could <EOS> <SOS>   can he be a sensible man  sir <EOS> <SOS>    no  my dear  i think not <EOS> <SOS>  i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse <EOS> <SOS>  there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter  which promises well <EOS> <SOS>  i am impatient to see him <EOS> <SOS>    in point of composition   said mary   his letter does not seem defective <EOS> <SOS>  the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new  yet i think it is well expressed <EOS> <SOS>   to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting <EOS> <SOS>  it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour <EOS> <SOS>  as for their mother  mr collins s letter had done away much of her ill will  and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure  which astonished her husband and daughters <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was punctual to his time  and was received with great politeness by the whole family <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet indeed said little  but the ladies were ready enough to talk  and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement  nor inclined to be silent himself <EOS> <SOS>  he was a tall  heavy looking young man of five and twenty <EOS> <SOS>  his air was grave and stately  and his manners were very formal <EOS> <SOS>  he had not been long seated before he complimented mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet on having so fine a family of daughters  said he had heard much of their beauty  but that  in this instance  fame had fallen short of the truth  and added  that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage <EOS> <SOS>  this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers  but mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  who quarrelled with no compliments  answered most readily   you are very kind  sir  i am sure  and i wish with all my heart it may prove so  for else they will be destitute enough <EOS> <SOS>  things are settled so oddly <EOS> <SOS>    you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate <EOS> <SOS>    ah <EOS> <SOS>  sir  i do indeed <EOS> <SOS>  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls  you must confess <EOS> <SOS>  not that i mean to find fault with  you   for such things i know are all chance in this world <EOS> <SOS>  there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed <EOS> <SOS>    i am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins   and could say much on the subject  but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate <EOS> <SOS>  but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them <EOS> <SOS>  at present i will not say more  but perhaps when we are better acquainted      he was interrupted by a summons to dinner  and the girls smiled on each other <EOS> <SOS>  they were not the only objects of mr collins s admiration <EOS> <SOS>  the hall  the dining room  and all its furniture were examined and praised  and his commendation of every thing would have touched mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s heart  but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property <EOS> <SOS>  the dinner too in its turn was highly admired  and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins  the excellence of its cookery was owing <EOS> <SOS>  but here he was set right by mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen <EOS> <SOS>  he begged pardon for having displeased her <EOS> <SOS>  in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended  but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xiv <EOS> <SOS>  during dinner  mr bennet scarcely spoke at all  but when the servants were withdrawn  he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest  and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine  by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes  and consideration for his comfort  appeared very remarkable <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet could not have chosen better <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was eloquent in her praise <EOS> <SOS>  the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner  and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank  such affability and condescension  as he had himself experienced from lady catherine <EOS> <SOS>  she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses  which he had already had the honour of preaching before her <EOS> <SOS>  she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings  and had sent for him only the saturday before  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew  but  he  had never seen any thing but affability in her <EOS> <SOS>  she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman  she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood  nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two  to visit his relations <EOS> <SOS>  she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with discretion  and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself   some shelves in the closets up stairs <EOS> <SOS>   that is all very proper and civil  i am sure   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman <EOS> <SOS>  it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her <EOS> <SOS>  does she live near you  sir <EOS> <SOS>    the garden in which stands my humble abode  is separated only by a lane from rosings park  her ladyship s residence <EOS> <SOS>    i think you said she was a widow  sir <EOS> <SOS>  has she any family <EOS> <SOS>    she has one only daughter  the heiress of rosings  and of very extensive property <EOS> <SOS>    ah <EOS> <SOS>   cried mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  shaking her head   then she is better off than many girls <EOS> <SOS>  and what sort of young lady is she <EOS> <SOS>  is she handsome <EOS> <SOS>    she is a most charming young lady indeed <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty  misse bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth <EOS> <SOS>  she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution  which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments  which she could not otherwise have failed of  as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education  and who still resides with them <EOS> <SOS>  but she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies <EOS> <SOS>    has she been presented <EOS> <SOS>  i do not remember her name among the ladies at court <EOS> <SOS>    her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town  and by that means  as i told lady catherine myself one day  has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament <EOS> <SOS>  her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea  and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies <EOS> <SOS>  i have more than once observed to lady catherine  that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most elevated rank  instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by her <EOS> <SOS>   these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay <EOS> <SOS>    you judge very properly   said mr bennet   and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy <EOS> <SOS>  may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment  or are the result of previous study <EOS> <SOS>    they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions  i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet s expectations were fully answered <EOS> <SOS>  his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped  and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment  maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance  and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth  requiring no partner in his pleasure <EOS> <SOS>  by tea time however the dose had been enough  and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again  and when tea was over  glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins readily assented  and a book was produced  but on beholding it   for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library   he started back  and begging pardon  protested that he never read novels <EOS> <SOS>   kitty stared at him  and lydia exclaimed <EOS> <SOS>   other books were produced  and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons <EOS> <SOS>  lydia gaped as he opened the volume  and before he had  with very monotonous solemnity  read three pages  she interrupted him with   do you know  mama  that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard  and if he does  colonel forster will hire him <EOS> <SOS>  my aunt told me so herself on saturday <EOS> <SOS>  i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it  and to ask when mr denny comes back from town <EOS> <SOS>   lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  but mr collins  much offended  laid aside his book  and said   i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp  though written solely for their benefit <EOS> <SOS>  it amazes me  i confess   for certainly  there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction <EOS> <SOS>  but i will no longer importune my young cousin <EOS> <SOS>   then turning to mr bennet  he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet accepted the challenge  observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption  and promised that it should not occur again  if he would resume his book  but mr collins  after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will  and should never resent her behaviour as any affront  seated himself at another table with mr bennet  and prepared for backgammon <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xv <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society  the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father  and though he belonged to one of the universities  he had merely kept the necessary terms  without forming at it any useful acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  the subjection in which his father had brought him up  had given him originally great humility of manner  but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head  living in retirement  and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity <EOS> <SOS>  a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his authority as a clergyman  and his rights as a rector  made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self importance and humility <EOS> <SOS>  having now a good house and very sufficient income  he intended to marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view  as he meant to chuse one of the daughters  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report <EOS> <SOS>  this was his plan of amends  of atonement  for inheriting their father s estate  and he thought it an excellent one  full of eligibility and suitableness  and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part <EOS> <SOS>  his plan did not vary on seeing them <EOS> <SOS>   missennet s lovely face confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority  and for the first evening  she  was his settled choice <EOS> <SOS>  the next morning  however  made an alteration  for in a quarter of an hour s t te   t te with mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet before breakfast  a conversation beginning with his parsonage house  and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes  that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn  produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on <EOS> <SOS>    as to her  younger  daughters she could not take upon her to say  she could not positively answer  but she did not  know  of any prepossession   her  eldest  daughter  she must just mention  she felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon engaged <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth  and it was soon done  done while mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was stirring the fire <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  equally next to jane in birth and beauty  succeeded her of course <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married  and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before  was now high in her good graces <EOS> <SOS>  lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten  every sister except mary agreed to go with her  and mr collins was to attend them  at the request of mr bennet  who was most anxious to get rid of him  and have his library to himself  for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast  and there he would continue  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection  but really talking to mr bennet  with little cessation  of his house and garden at hunsford <EOS> <SOS>  such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly <EOS> <SOS>  in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as he told elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house  he was used to be free from them there  his civility  therefore  was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk  and mr collins  being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader  was extremely well pleased to close his large book  and go <EOS> <SOS>  in pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his cousins  their time passed till they entered meryton <EOS> <SOS>  the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by  him  <EOS> <SOS>  their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed  or a really new muslin in a shop window  could recal them <EOS> <SOS>  but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man  whom they had never seen before  of most gentleman like appearance  walking with an officer on the other side of the way <EOS> <SOS>  the officer was the very mr denny  concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire  and he bowed as they passed <EOS> <SOS>  all were struck with the stranger s air  all wondered who he could be  and kitty and lydia  determined if possible to find out  led the way across the street  under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop  and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot <EOS> <SOS>  mr denny addressed them directly  and entreated permission to introduce his friend  mr wickham  who had returned with him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps <EOS> <SOS>  this was exactly as it should be  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming <EOS> <SOS>  his appearance was greatly in his favour  he had all the best part of beauty  a fine countenance  a good figure  and very pleasing address <EOS> <SOS>  the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation  a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably  when the sound of horses drew their notice  and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street <EOS> <SOS>  on distinguishing the ladies of the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and began the usual civilities <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was the principal spokesman  and missennet the principal object <EOS> <SOS>  he was then  he said  on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy corroborated it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger  and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other  was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting <EOS> <SOS>  both changed colour  one looked white  the other red <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham  after a few moments  touched his hat  a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return <EOS> <SOS>  what could be the meaning of it <EOS> <SOS>   it was impossible to imagine  it was impossible not to long to know <EOS> <SOS>  in another minute mr bingley  but without seeming to have noticed what passed  took leave and rode on with his friend <EOS> <SOS>  mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips s house  and then made their bows  in spite of missydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in  and even in spite of mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  throwing up the parlour window  and loudly seconding the invitation <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two eldest  from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home  which  as their own carriage had not fetched them  she should have known nothing about  if she had not happened to see mr jones s shop boy in the street  who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the missennets were come away  when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane s introduction of him <EOS> <SOS>  she received him with her very best politeness  which he returned with as much more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other  of whom  however  she could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that mr denny had brought him from london  and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the     shire <EOS> <SOS>  she had been watching him the last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation  but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers  who in comparison with the stranger  were become  stupid  disagreeable fellows <EOS> <SOS>   some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day  and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham  and give him an invitation also  if the family from longbourn would come in the evening <EOS> <SOS>  this was agreed to  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards <EOS> <SOS>  the prospect of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual good spirits <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless <EOS> <SOS>  as they walked home  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen  but though jane would have defended either or both  had they appeared to be wrong  she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins on his return highly gratified mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet by admiring mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips s manners and politeness <EOS> <SOS>  he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a more elegant woman  for she had not only received him with the utmost civility  but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening  although utterly unknown to her before <EOS> <SOS>  something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them  but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xvi <EOS> <SOS>  as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt  and all mr collins s scruples of leaving mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton  and the girls had the pleasure of hearing  as they entered the drawing room  that mr wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation  and was then in the house <EOS> <SOS>  when this information was given  and they had all taken their seats  mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire  and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification  but when mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips understood from him what rosings was  and who was its proprietor  when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms  and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room <EOS> <SOS>  in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode  and the improvements it was receiving  he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them  and he found in mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could <EOS> <SOS>  to the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece  the interval of waiting appeared very long <EOS> <SOS>  it was over at last however <EOS> <SOS>  the gentlemen did approach  and when mr wickham walked into the room  elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before  nor thinking of him since  with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration <EOS> <SOS>  the officers of the     shire were in general a very creditable  gentleman like set  and the best of them were of the present party  but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person  countenance  air  and walk  as  they  were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips  breathing port wine  who followed them into the room <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself  and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation  though it was only on its being a wet night  and on the probability of a rainy season  made her feel that the commonest  dullest  most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker <EOS> <SOS>  with such rivals for the notice of the fair  as mr wickham and the officers  mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance  to the young ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  and was  by her watchfulness  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin <EOS> <SOS>  when the card tables were placed  he had an opportunity of obliging her in return  by sitting down to whist <EOS> <SOS>   i know little of the game  at present   said he   but i shall be glad to improve myself  for in my situation of life      mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips was very thankful for his compliance  but could not wait for his reason <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia <EOS> <SOS>  at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes  to have attention for any one in particular <EOS> <SOS>  allowing for the common demands of the game  mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told  the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  she dared not even mention that gentleman <EOS> <SOS>  her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham began the subject himself <EOS> <SOS>  he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her answer  asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there <EOS> <SOS>   about a month   said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the subject drop  added   he is a man of very large property in derbyshire  i understand <EOS> <SOS>    yes   replied wickham    his estate there is a noble one <EOS> <SOS>  a clear ten thousand per annum <EOS> <SOS>  you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself  for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could not but look surprised <EOS> <SOS>   you may well be surprised  missennet  at such an assertion  after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday <EOS> <SOS>   are you much acquainted with mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    as much as i ever wish to be   cried elizabeth warmly    i have spent four days in the same house with him  and i think him very disagreeable <EOS> <SOS>    i have no right to give  my  opinion   said wickham   as to his being agreeable or otherwise <EOS> <SOS>  i am not qualified to form one <EOS> <SOS>  i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge <EOS> <SOS>  it is impossible for  me  to be impartial <EOS> <SOS>  but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish  and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else <EOS> <SOS>   here you are in your own family <EOS> <SOS>    upon my word i say no more  here  than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood  except netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  he is not at all liked in hertfordshire <EOS> <SOS>  every body is disgusted with his pride <EOS> <SOS>  you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one <EOS> <SOS>    i cannot pretend to be sorry   said wickham  after a short interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts  but with  him  i believe it does not often happen <EOS> <SOS>  the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as he chuses to be seen <EOS> <SOS>    i should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an ill tempered man <EOS> <SOS>   wickham only shook his head <EOS> <SOS>   i wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking   whether he is likely to be in this country much longer <EOS> <SOS>    i do not at all know  but i  heard  nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  i hope your plans in favour of the     shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  no  it is not for  me  to be driven away by mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  if  he  wishes to avoid seeing  me   he must go <EOS> <SOS>  we are not on friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but i have no reason for avoiding  him  but what i might proclaim to all the world  a sense of very great ill usage  and most painful regrets at his being what he is <EOS> <SOS>  his father  missennet  the late mr darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed  and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections <EOS> <SOS>  his behaviour to myself has been scandalous  but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing  rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham began to speak on more general topics  meryton  the neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter especially  with gentle but very intelligible gallantry <EOS> <SOS>   it was the prospect of constant society  and good society   he added   which was my chief inducement to enter the     shire <EOS> <SOS>  i knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them <EOS> <SOS>  society  i own  is necessary to me <EOS> <SOS>  i have been a disappointed man  and my spirits will not bear solitude <EOS> <SOS>  i  must  have employment and society <EOS> <SOS>  a military life is not what i was intended for  but circumstances have now made it eligible <EOS> <SOS>  the church  ought  to have been my profession  i was brought up for the church  and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living  had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now <EOS> <SOS>    indeed <EOS> <SOS>    yes  the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift <EOS> <SOS>  he was my godfather  and excessively attached to me <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot do justice to his kindness <EOS> <SOS>  he meant to provide for me amply  and thought he had done it  but when the living fell  it was given elsewhere <EOS> <SOS>    good heavens <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth   but how could  that  be <EOS> <SOS>   how could his will be disregarded <EOS> <SOS>   why did not you seek legal redress <EOS> <SOS>    there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law <EOS> <SOS>  a man of honour could not have doubted the intention  but mr darcy chose to doubt it  or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance  imprudence  in short any thing or nothing <EOS> <SOS>  certain it is  that the living became vacant two years ago  exactly as i was of an age to hold it  and that it was given to another man  and no less certain is it  that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it <EOS> <SOS>  i have a warm  unguarded temper  and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion  of  him  and  to  him  too freely <EOS> <SOS>  i can recal nothing worse <EOS> <SOS>  but the fact is  that we are very different sort of men  and that he hates me <EOS> <SOS>    this is quite shocking <EOS> <SOS>   he deserves to be publicly disgraced <EOS> <SOS>    some time or other he  will  be  but it shall not be by  me  <EOS> <SOS>  till i can forget his father  i can never defy or expose  him  <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them <EOS> <SOS>   but what   said she  after a pause   can have been his motive <EOS> <SOS>   what can have induced him to behave so cruelly <EOS> <SOS>    a thorough  determined dislike of me  a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy <EOS> <SOS>  had the late mr darcy liked me less  his son might have borne with me better  but his father s uncommon attachment to me  irritated him i believe very early in life <EOS> <SOS>  he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood  the sort of preference which was often given me <EOS> <SOS>    i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this  though i have never liked him  i had not thought so very ill of him  i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general  but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such injustice  such inhumanity as this <EOS> <SOS>   after a few minutes reflection  however  she continued   i  do  remember his boasting one day  at netherfield  of the implacability of his resentments  of his having an unforgiving temper <EOS> <SOS>  his disposition must be dreadful <EOS> <SOS>    i will not trust myself on the subject   replied wickham    i  can hardly be just to him <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was again deep in thought  and after a time exclaimed   to treat in such a manner  the god son  the friend  the favourite of his father <EOS> <SOS>    she could have added   a young man too  like  you   whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable   but she contented herself with  and one  too  who had probably been his own companion from childhood  connected together  as i think you said  in the closest manner <EOS> <SOS>    we were born in the same parish  within the same park  the greatest part of our youth was passed together  inmates of the same house  sharing the same amusements  objects of the same parental care <EOS> <SOS>   my  father began life in the profession which your uncle  mr philips  appears to do so much credit to  but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy  and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property <EOS> <SOS>  he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy  a most intimate  confidential friend <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance  and when immediately before my father s death  mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me  i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him   as of affection to myself <EOS> <SOS>    how strange <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   how abominable <EOS> <SOS>   i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you <EOS> <SOS>   if from no better motive  that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest   for dishonesty i must call it <EOS> <SOS>    it  is  wonderful    replied wickham    for almost all his actions may be traced to pride   and pride has often been his best friend <EOS> <SOS>  it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling <EOS> <SOS>  but we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour to me  there were stronger impulses even than pride <EOS> <SOS>    can such abominable pride as his  have ever done him good <EOS> <SOS>    yes <EOS> <SOS>  it has often led him to be liberal and generous   to give his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants  and relieve the poor <EOS> <SOS>  family pride  and  filial  pride  for he is very proud of what his father was  have done this <EOS> <SOS>  not to appear to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities  or lose the influence of the pemberley house  is a powerful motive <EOS> <SOS>  he has also  brotherly  pride  which with  some  brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers <EOS> <SOS>    what sort of a girl is missarcy <EOS> <SOS>   he shook his head <EOS> <SOS>    i wish i could call her amiable <EOS> <SOS>  it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy <EOS> <SOS>  but she is too much like her brother   very  very proud <EOS> <SOS>   as a child  she was affectionate and pleasing  and extremely fond of me  and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement <EOS> <SOS>  but she is nothing to me now <EOS> <SOS>  she is a handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  and i understand highly accomplished <EOS> <SOS>  since her father s death  her home has been london  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her education <EOS> <SOS>   after many pauses and many trials of other subjects  elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first  and saying   i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>  how can mr bingley  who seems good humour itself  and is  i really believe  truly amiable  be in friendship with such a man <EOS> <SOS>  how can they suit each other <EOS> <SOS>   do you know mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>    not at all <EOS> <SOS>    he is a sweet tempered  amiable  charming man <EOS> <SOS>  he cannot know what mr darcy is <EOS> <SOS>    probably not   but mr darcy can please where he chuses <EOS> <SOS>  he does not want abilities <EOS> <SOS>  he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while <EOS> <SOS>  among those who are at all his equals in consequence  he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous <EOS> <SOS>  his pride never deserts him  but with the rich  he is liberal minded  just  sincere  rational  honourable  and perhaps agreeable   allowing something for fortune and figure <EOS> <SOS>   the whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered round the other table  and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips <EOS> <SOS>   the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter <EOS> <SOS>  it had not been very great  he had lost every point  but when mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips began to express her concern thereupon  he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance  that he considered the money as a mere trifle  and begged she would not make herself uneasy <EOS> <SOS>   i know very well  madam   said he   that when persons sit down to a card table  they must take their chance of these things   and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object <EOS> <SOS>  there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same  but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh  i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters <EOS> <SOS>   mr wickham s attention was caught  and after observing mr collins for a few moments  he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine de bourgh   she replied   has very lately given him a living <EOS> <SOS>  i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long <EOS> <SOS>    you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters  consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    no  indeed  i did not <EOS> <SOS>   i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections <EOS> <SOS>  i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday <EOS> <SOS>    her daughter  misse bourgh  will have a very large fortune  and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates <EOS> <SOS>   this information made elizabeth smile  as she thought of poor missingley <EOS> <SOS>  vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself  if he were already self destined to another <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins   said she   speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter  but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship  i suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that in spite of her being his patroness  she is an arrogant  conceited woman <EOS> <SOS>    i believe her to be both in a great degree   replied wickham   i have not seen her for many years  but i very well remember that i never liked her  and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent <EOS> <SOS>  she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever  but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune  part from her authoritative manner  and the rest from the pride of her nephew  who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it  and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham s attentions <EOS> <SOS>  there could be no conversation in the noise of mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips s supper party  but his manners recommended him to every body <EOS> <SOS>  whatever he said  was said well  and whatever he did  done gracefully <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth went away with her head full of him <EOS> <SOS>  she could think of nothing but of mr wickham  and of what he had told her  all the way home  but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went  for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent <EOS> <SOS>  lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets  of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won  and mr collins  in describing the civility of mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper  and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins  had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xvii <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth related to jane the next day  what had passed between mr wickham and herself <EOS> <SOS>  jane listened with astonishment and concern   she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley s regard  and yet  it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham <EOS> <SOS>   the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness  was enough to interest all her tender feelings  and nothing therefore remained to be done  but to think well of them both  to defend the conduct of each  and throw into the account of accident or mistake  whatever could not be otherwise explained <EOS> <SOS>   they have both   said she   been deceived  i dare say  in some way or other  of which we can form no idea <EOS> <SOS>  interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other <EOS> <SOS>  it is  in short  impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side <EOS> <SOS>    very true  indeed   and now  my dear jane  what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business <EOS> <SOS>   do clear  them  too  or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody <EOS> <SOS>    laugh as much as you chuse  but you will not laugh me out of my opinion <EOS> <SOS>  my dearest lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy  to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner   one  whom his father had promised to provide for <EOS> <SOS>   it is impossible <EOS> <SOS>  no man of common humanity  no man who had any value for his character  could be capable of it <EOS> <SOS>  can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  no <EOS> <SOS>    i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on  than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night  names  facts  every thing mentioned without ceremony <EOS> <SOS>   if it be not so  let mr darcy contradict it <EOS> <SOS>  besides  there was truth in his looks <EOS> <SOS>    it is difficult indeed  it is distressing <EOS> <SOS>   one does not know what to think <EOS> <SOS>    i beg your pardon   one knows exactly what to think <EOS> <SOS>   but jane could think with certainty on only one point   that mr bingley  if he  had been  imposed on  would have much to suffer when the affair became public <EOS> <SOS>  the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed  by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking  mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield  which was fixed for the following tuesday <EOS> <SOS>  the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again  called it an age since they had met  and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation <EOS> <SOS>  to the rest of the family they paid little attention  avoiding mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet as much as possible  saying not much to elizabeth  and nothing at all to the others <EOS> <SOS>  they were soon gone again  rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise  and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s civilities <EOS> <SOS>  the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter  and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself  instead of a ceremonious card <EOS> <SOS>  jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends  and the attentions of their brother  and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham  and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy s looks and behaviour <EOS> <SOS>  the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia  depended less on any single event  or any particular person  for though they each  like elizabeth  meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham  he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them  and a ball was at any rate  a ball <EOS> <SOS>  and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it <EOS> <SOS>   while i can have my mornings to myself   said she   it is enough <EOS> <SOS>   i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements <EOS> <SOS>  society has claims on us all  and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion  that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins  she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley s invitation  and if he did  whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement  and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head  and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop  or lady catherine de bourgh  by venturing to dance <EOS> <SOS>   i am by no means of opinion  i assure you   said he   that a ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to respectable people  can have any evil tendency  and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening  and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours  misslizabeth  for the two first dances especially   a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause  and not to any disrespect for her <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth felt herself completely taken in <EOS> <SOS>  she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances   and to have mr collins instead <EOS> <SOS>  her liveliness had been never worse timed <EOS> <SOS>  there was no help for it however <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer  and mr collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could <EOS> <SOS>  she was not the better pleased with his gallantry  from the idea it suggested of something more <EOS> <SOS>   it now first struck her  that  she  was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage  and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings  in the absence of more eligible visitors <EOS> <SOS>  the idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more astonished than gratified herself  by this effect of her charms  it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to  her  <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint  being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins might never make the offer  and till he did  it was useless to quarrel about him <EOS> <SOS>  if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of  the younger missennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time  for from the day of the invitation  to the day of the ball  there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once <EOS> <SOS>  no aunt  no officers  no news could be sought after   the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy <EOS> <SOS>  even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather  which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham  and nothing less than a dance on tuesday  could have made such a friday  saturday  sunday and monday  endurable to kitty and lydia <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xviii <EOS> <SOS>  till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled  a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her <EOS> <SOS>  the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her <EOS> <SOS>  she had dressed with more than usual care  and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart  trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening <EOS> <SOS>  but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy s pleasure in the bingleys  invitation to the officers  and though this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny  to whom lydia eagerly applied  and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before  and was not yet returned  adding  with a significant smile   i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now  if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here <EOS> <SOS>   this part of his intelligence  though unheard by lydia  was caught by elizabeth  and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just  every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment  that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make <EOS> <SOS>   attention  forbearance  patience with darcy  was injury to wickham <EOS> <SOS>  she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned away with a degree of ill humour  which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley  whose blind partiality provoked her <EOS> <SOS>  but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour  and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not dwell long on her spirits  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas  whom she had not seen for a week  she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin  and to point him out to her particular notice <EOS> <SOS>  the two first dances  however  brought a return of distress  they were dances of mortification <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins  awkward and solemn  apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without being aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give <EOS> <SOS>  the moment of her release from him was ecstacy <EOS> <SOS>  she danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of talking of wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked <EOS> <SOS>  when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas  and was in conversation with her  when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy  who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand  that  without knowing what she did  she accepted him <EOS> <SOS>  he walked away again immediately  and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind  charlotte tried to console her <EOS> <SOS>   i dare say you will find him very agreeable <EOS> <SOS>    heaven forbid <EOS> <SOS>    that  would be the greatest misfortune of all <EOS> <SOS>   to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate <EOS> <SOS>   do not wish me such an evil <EOS> <SOS>   when the dancing recommenced  however  and darcy approached to claim her hand  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth made no answer  and took her place in the set  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy  and reading in her neighbours  looks their equal amazement in beholding it <EOS> <SOS>  they stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances  and at first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk  she made some slight observation on the dance <EOS> <SOS>  he replied  and was again silent <EOS> <SOS>  after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  it is  your  turn to say something now  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    i  talked about the dance  and  you  ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room  or the number of couples <EOS> <SOS>   he smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said <EOS> <SOS>   very well <EOS> <SOS>   that reply will do for the present <EOS> <SOS>   perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones <EOS> <SOS>   but  now  we may be silent <EOS> <SOS>    do you talk by rule then  while you are dancing <EOS> <SOS>    sometimes <EOS> <SOS>  one must speak a little  you know <EOS> <SOS>  it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the advantage of  some   conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible <EOS> <SOS>    are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine <EOS> <SOS>    both   replied elizabeth archly   for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds <EOS> <SOS>   we are each of an unsocial  taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb <EOS> <SOS>    this is no very striking resemblance of your own character  i am sure   said he <EOS> <SOS>   how near it may be to  mine   i cannot pretend to say <EOS> <SOS>    you  think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly <EOS> <SOS>    i must not decide on my own performance <EOS> <SOS>   he made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton <EOS> <SOS>  she answered in the affirmative  and  unable to resist the temptation  added   when you met us there the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>   the effect was immediate <EOS> <SOS>  a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on <EOS> <SOS>  at length darcy spoke  and in a constrained manner said   mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making  friends  whether he may be equally capable of  retaining  them  is less certain <EOS> <SOS>    he has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship   replied elizabeth with emphasis   and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life <EOS> <SOS>   darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the subject <EOS> <SOS>  at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room  but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner <EOS> <SOS>   i have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir <EOS> <SOS>  such very superior dancing is not often seen <EOS> <SOS>  it is evident that you belong to the first circles <EOS> <SOS>  allow me to say  however  that your fair partner does not disgrace you  and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable event  my dear missliza   glancing at her sister and bingley   shall take place <EOS> <SOS>  what congratulations will then flow in <EOS> <SOS>  i appeal to mr darcy   but let me not interrupt you  sir <EOS> <SOS>   you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me <EOS> <SOS>   the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane  who were dancing together <EOS> <SOS>  recovering himself  however  shortly  he turned to his partner  and said   sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of <EOS> <SOS>    i do not think we were speaking at all <EOS> <SOS>  sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves <EOS> <SOS>   we have tried two or three subjects already without success  and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine <EOS> <SOS>    what think you of books <EOS> <SOS>   said he  smiling <EOS> <SOS>   books  oh <EOS> <SOS>  no <EOS> <SOS>   i am sure we never read the same  or not with the same feelings <EOS> <SOS>    i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at least be no want of subject <EOS> <SOS>   we may compare our different opinions <EOS> <SOS>    no  i cannot talk of books in a ball room  my head is always full of something else <EOS> <SOS>    the  present  always occupies you in such scenes  does it <EOS> <SOS>   said he  with a look of doubt <EOS> <SOS>   yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember hearing you once say  mr darcy  that you hardly ever forgave  that your resentment once created was unappeasable <EOS> <SOS>  you are very cautious  i suppose  as to its  being created  <EOS> <SOS>    i am   said he  with a firm voice <EOS> <SOS>   and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice <EOS> <SOS>    i hope not <EOS> <SOS>    it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first <EOS> <SOS>    may i ask to what these questions tend <EOS> <SOS>    merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she  endeavouring to shake off her gravity <EOS> <SOS>   i am trying to make it out <EOS> <SOS>    and what is your success <EOS> <SOS>   she shook her head <EOS> <SOS>   i do not get on at all <EOS> <SOS>  i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly <EOS> <SOS>    i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that report may vary greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  missennet  that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either <EOS> <SOS>    but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another opportunity <EOS> <SOS>    i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly replied <EOS> <SOS>  she said no more  and they went down the other dance and parted in silence  on each side dissatisfied  though not to an equal degree  for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and directed all his anger against another <EOS> <SOS>  they had not long separated when missingley came towards her  and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her   so  missliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham <EOS> <SOS>   your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking me a thousand questions  and i find that the young man forgot to tell you  among his other communications  that he was the son of old wickham  the late mr darcy s steward <EOS> <SOS>  let me recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr darcy s using him ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has been always remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner <EOS> <SOS>  i do not know the particulars  but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned  and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way <EOS> <SOS>  his coming into the country at all  is a most insolent thing indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it <EOS> <SOS>  i pity you  missliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt  but really considering his descent  one could not expect much better <EOS> <SOS>    his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same   said elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward  and of  that   i can assure you  he informed me himself <EOS> <SOS>    i beg your pardon   replied missingley  turning away with a sneer <EOS> <SOS>   excuse my interference <EOS> <SOS>   it was kindly meant <EOS> <SOS>    insolent girl <EOS> <SOS>   said elizabeth to herself <EOS> <SOS>    you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this <EOS> <SOS>  i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   she then sought her eldest sister  who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley <EOS> <SOS>  jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for wickham  resentment against his enemies  and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness <EOS> <SOS>   i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s   what you have learnt about mr wickham <EOS> <SOS>  but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon <EOS> <SOS>    no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley does not know the whole of his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy  but he will vouch for the good conduct  the probity and honour of his friend  and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received  and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s  mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man <EOS> <SOS>  i am afraid he has been very imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard <EOS> <SOS>    mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself <EOS> <SOS>    no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton <EOS> <SOS>    this account then is what he has received from mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  i am perfectly satisfied <EOS> <SOS>  but what does he say of the living <EOS> <SOS>    he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once  but he believes that it was left to him  conditionally  only <EOS> <SOS>    i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity   said elizabeth warmly   but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before <EOS> <SOS>   she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each  and on which there could be no difference of sentiment <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard  and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it <EOS> <SOS>  on their being joined by mr bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew to missucas  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied  before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery <EOS> <SOS>   i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness <EOS> <SOS>  i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin misse bourgh  and of her mother lady catherine <EOS> <SOS>  how wonderfully these sort of things occur <EOS> <SOS>  who would have thought of my meeting with  perhaps  a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly <EOS> <SOS>   i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him  which i am now going to do  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before <EOS> <SOS>  my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology <EOS> <SOS>    you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    indeed i am <EOS> <SOS>  i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier <EOS> <SOS>  i believe him to be lady catherine s  nephew  <EOS> <SOS>  it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong to mr darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination  and when she ceased speaking  replied thus   my dear misslizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding  but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom  provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained <EOS> <SOS>  you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty <EOS> <SOS>  pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself <EOS> <SOS>   and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident <EOS> <SOS>  her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow  and though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words  apology    hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh <EOS> <SOS>    it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and mr darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow  and moved another way <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins then returned to elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied with my reception <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention <EOS> <SOS>  he answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid me the compliment of saying  that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily <EOS> <SOS>  it was really a very handsome thought <EOS> <SOS>  upon the whole  i am much pleased with him <EOS> <SOS>   as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as jane <EOS> <SOS>  she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she felt capable under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters <EOS> <SOS>  her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near her  lest she might hear too much <EOS> <SOS>  when they sat down to supper  therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas  freely  openly  and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley <EOS> <SOS>   it was an animating subject  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match <EOS> <SOS>  his being such a charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from them  were the first points of self gratulation  and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane  and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do <EOS> <SOS>  it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her younger daughters  as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked <EOS> <SOS>  it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on such occasions it is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life <EOS> <SOS>  she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it <EOS> <SOS>  in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper  for to her inexpressible vexation  she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy  who sat opposite to them <EOS> <SOS>  her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical <EOS> <SOS>   what is mr darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing  he  may not like to hear <EOS> <SOS>    for heaven s sake  madam  speak lower <EOS> <SOS>   what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing <EOS> <SOS>   nothing that she could say  however  had any influence <EOS> <SOS>  her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation <EOS> <SOS>  she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy  though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  for though he was not always looking at her mother  she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her <EOS> <SOS>  the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity <EOS> <SOS>  at length however mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had no more to say  and lady lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth now began to revive <EOS> <SOS>  but not long was the interval of tranquillity  for when supper was over  singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the company <EOS> <SOS>  by many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance   but in vain  mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her  and she began her song <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of half a minute began another <EOS> <SOS>  mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display  her voice was weak  and her manner affected <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was in agonies <EOS> <SOS>  she looked at jane  to see how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to bingley <EOS> <SOS>  she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs of derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued however impenetrably grave <EOS> <SOS>  she looked at her father to entreat his interference  lest mary should be singing all night <EOS> <SOS>  he took the hint  and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud   that will do extremely well  child <EOS> <SOS>  you have delighted us long enough <EOS> <SOS>  let the other young ladies have time to exhibit <EOS> <SOS>   mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted  and elizabeth sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech  was afraid her anxiety had done no good <EOS> <SOS>   others of the party were now applied to <EOS> <SOS>   if i   said mr collins   were so fortunate as to be able to sing  i should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the company with an air  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman <EOS> <SOS>   i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there are certainly other things to be attended to <EOS> <SOS>  the rector of a parish has much to do <EOS> <SOS>   in the first place  he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron <EOS> <SOS>  he must write his own sermons  and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible <EOS> <SOS>  and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body  especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot acquit him of that duty  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family <EOS> <SOS>   and with a bow to mr darcy  he concluded his speech  which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room <EOS> <SOS>   many stared <EOS> <SOS>   many smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young man <EOS> <SOS>  to elizabeth it appeared  that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit  or finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed <EOS> <SOS>  that his two sisters and mr darcy  however  should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough  and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman  or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable <EOS> <SOS>  the rest of the evening brought her little amusement <EOS> <SOS>  she was teazed by mr collins  who continued most perseveringly by her side  and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again  put it out of her power to dance with others <EOS> <SOS>  in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room <EOS> <SOS>  he assured her that as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her  and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening <EOS> <SOS>  there was no arguing upon such a project <EOS> <SOS>  she owed her greatest relief to her friend missucas  who often joined them  and good naturedly engaged mr collins s conversation to herself <EOS> <SOS>  she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy s farther notice  though often standing within a very short distance of her  quite disengaged  he never came near enough to speak <EOS> <SOS>  she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham  and rejoiced in it <EOS> <SOS>  the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  and by a manoeuvre of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone  which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue  and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves <EOS> <SOS>  they repulsed every attempt of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet at conversation  and by so doing  threw a languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins  who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment  and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests <EOS> <SOS>  darcy said nothing at all <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet  in equal silence  was enjoying the scene <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley and jane were standing together  a little detached from the rest  and talked only to each other <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst or missingley  and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  lord  how tired i am <EOS> <SOS>   accompanied by a violent yawn <EOS> <SOS>  when at length they arose to take leave  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn  and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley  to assure him how happy he would make them  by eating a family dinner with them at any time  without the ceremony of a formal invitation <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was all grateful pleasure  and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her  after his return from london  whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements  new carriages and wedding clothes  she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield  in the course of three or four months <EOS> <SOS>  of having another daughter married to mr collins  she thought with equal certainty  and with considerable  though not equal  pleasure <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children  and though the man and the match were quite good enough for  her   the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xix <EOS> <SOS>  the next day opened a new scene at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins made his declaration in form <EOS> <SOS>  having resolved to do it without loss of time  as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday  and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment  he set about it in a very orderly manner  with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business <EOS> <SOS>  on finding mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together  soon after breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words   may i hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth  when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning <EOS> <SOS>   before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet instantly answered   oh dear <EOS> <SOS>   yes  certainly <EOS> <SOS>   i am sure lizzy will be very happy  i am sure she can have no objection <EOS> <SOS>   come  kitty  i want you up stairs <EOS> <SOS>   and gathering her work together  she was hastening away  when elizabeth called out   dear ma am  do not go <EOS> <SOS>   i beg you will not go <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins must excuse me <EOS> <SOS>   he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear <EOS> <SOS>  i am going away myself <EOS> <SOS>    no  no  nonsense  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>   i desire you will stay where you are <EOS> <SOS>    and upon elizabeth s seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed looks  about to escape  she added   lizzy  i  insist  upon your staying and hearing mr collins <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction  and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down again  and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and kitty walked off  and as soon as they were gone mr collins began <EOS> <SOS>   believe me  my dear misslizabeth  that your modesty  so far from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other perfections <EOS> <SOS>  you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there  not  been this little unwillingness  but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address <EOS> <SOS>  you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse  however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken <EOS> <SOS>  almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life <EOS> <SOS>  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject  perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying  and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife  as i certainly did <EOS> <SOS>   the idea of mr collins  with all his solemn composure  being run away with by his feelings  made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther  and he continued   my reasons for marrying are  first  that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to set the example of matrimony in his parish <EOS> <SOS>  secondly  that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness  and thirdly  which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier  that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness <EOS> <SOS>  twice has she condescended to give me her opinion  unasked too <EOS> <SOS>   on this subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford  between our pools at quadrille  while mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson was arranging misse bourgh s foot stool  that she said   mr collins  you must marry <EOS> <SOS>  a clergyman like you must marry <EOS> <SOS>   chuse properly  chuse a gentlewoman for  my  sake  and for your  own   let her be an active  useful sort of person  not brought up high  but able to make a small income go a good way <EOS> <SOS>  this is my advice <EOS> <SOS>  find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to hunsford  and i will visit her <EOS> <SOS>   allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair cousin  that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer <EOS> <SOS>  you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe  and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite <EOS> <SOS>  thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood  where i assure you there are many amiable young women <EOS> <SOS>  but the fact is  that being  as i am  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father   who  however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters  that the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the melancholy event takes place  which  however  as i have already said  may not be for several years <EOS> <SOS>  this has been my motive  my fair cousin  and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem <EOS> <SOS>  and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection <EOS> <SOS>  to fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of that nature on your father  since i am well aware that it could not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents <EOS> <SOS>  which will not be yours till after your mother s decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to <EOS> <SOS>  on that head  therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married <EOS> <SOS>   it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now <EOS> <SOS>   you are too hasty  sir   she cried <EOS> <SOS>   you forget that i have made no answer <EOS> <SOS>  let me do it without farther loss of time <EOS> <SOS>  accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me <EOS> <SOS>  i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals  but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them <EOS> <SOS>    i am not now to learn   replied mr collins  with a formal wave of the hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he first applies for their favour  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time <EOS> <SOS>  i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long <EOS> <SOS>    upon my word  sir   cried elizabeth   your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration <EOS> <SOS>  i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time <EOS> <SOS>  i am perfectly serious in my refusal <EOS> <SOS>   you could not make  me  happy  and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make  you  so <EOS> <SOS>   nay  were your friend lady catherine to know me  i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation <EOS> <SOS>    were it certain that lady catherine would think so   said mr collins very gravely   but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you <EOS> <SOS>  and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty  economy  and other amiable qualifications <EOS> <SOS>    indeed  mr collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary <EOS> <SOS>  you must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment of believing what i say <EOS> <SOS>  i wish you very happy and very rich  and by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise <EOS> <SOS>  in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any self reproach <EOS> <SOS>  this matter may be considered  therefore  as finally settled <EOS> <SOS>   and rising as she thus spoke  she would have quitted the room  had not mr collins thus addressed her   when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present  because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character <EOS> <SOS>    really  mr collins   cried elizabeth with some warmth   you puzzle me exceedingly <EOS> <SOS>  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement  i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one <EOS> <SOS>    you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course <EOS> <SOS>  my reasons for believing it are briefly these   it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance  or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable <EOS> <SOS>  my situation in life  my connections with the family of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances highly in my favour  and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you <EOS> <SOS>  your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications <EOS> <SOS>  as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me  i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the usual practice of elegant females <EOS> <SOS>    i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man <EOS> <SOS>  i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere <EOS> <SOS>  i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely impossible <EOS> <SOS>  my feelings in every respect forbid it <EOS> <SOS>  can i speak plainer <EOS> <SOS>  do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you  but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart <EOS> <SOS>    you are uniformly charming <EOS> <SOS>   cried he  with an air of awkward gallantry   and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals will not fail of being acceptable <EOS> <SOS>   to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew  determined  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement  to apply to her father  whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive  and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xx <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love  for mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase  than she entered the breakfast room  and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure  and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview  with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character <EOS> <SOS>  this information  however  startled mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared not to believe it  and could not help saying so <EOS> <SOS>   but depend upon it  mr collins   she added   that lizzy shall be brought to reason <EOS> <SOS>  i will speak to her about it myself directly <EOS> <SOS>  she is a very headstrong foolish girl  and does not know her own interest  but i will  make  her know it <EOS> <SOS>    pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried mr collins   but if she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state <EOS> <SOS>  if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit  perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me  because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not contribute much to my felicity <EOS> <SOS>    sir  you quite misunderstand me   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  alarmed <EOS> <SOS>   lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these <EOS> <SOS>  in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived <EOS> <SOS>  i will go directly to mr bennet  and we shall very soon settle it with her  i am sure <EOS> <SOS>   she would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to her husband  called out as she entered the library   oh <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet  you are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar <EOS> <SOS>  you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins  for she vows she will not have him  and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have  her  <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication <EOS> <SOS>   i have not the pleasure of understanding you   said he  when she had finished her speech <EOS> <SOS>   of what are you talking <EOS> <SOS>    of mr collins and lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  lizzy declares she will not have mr collins  and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy <EOS> <SOS>    and what am i to do on the occasion <EOS> <SOS>   it seems an hopeless business <EOS> <SOS>    speak to lizzy about it yourself <EOS> <SOS>  tell her that you insist upon her marrying him <EOS> <SOS>    let her be called down <EOS> <SOS>  she shall hear my opinion <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet rang the bell  and misslizabeth was summoned to the library <EOS> <SOS>   come here  child   cried her father as she appeared <EOS> <SOS>   i have sent for you on an affair of importance <EOS> <SOS>  i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage <EOS> <SOS>  is it true <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth replied that it was <EOS> <SOS>   very well  and this offer of marriage you have refused <EOS> <SOS>    i have  sir <EOS> <SOS>    very well <EOS> <SOS>  we now come to the point <EOS> <SOS>  your mother insists upon your accepting it <EOS> <SOS>  is not it so  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>    yes  or i will never see her again <EOS> <SOS>    an unhappy alternative is before you  elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents <EOS> <SOS>   your mother will never see you again if you do  not  marry mr collins  and i will never see you again if you  do  <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning  but mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished  was excessively disappointed <EOS> <SOS>   what do you mean  mr bennet  by talking in this way <EOS> <SOS>  you promised me to  insist  upon her marrying him <EOS> <SOS>    my dear   replied her husband   i have two small favours to request <EOS> <SOS>  first  that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion  and secondly  of my room <EOS> <SOS>  i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be <EOS> <SOS>   not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband  did mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet give up the point <EOS> <SOS>  she talked to elizabeth again and again  coaxed and threatened her by turns <EOS> <SOS>  she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest  but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering   and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks <EOS> <SOS>  though her manner varied however  her determination never did <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had passed <EOS> <SOS>  he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him  and though his pride was hurt  he suffered in no other way <EOS> <SOS>  his regard for her was quite imaginary  and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret <EOS> <SOS>  while the family were in this confusion  charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them <EOS> <SOS>  she was met in the vestibule by lydia  who  flying to her  cried in a half whisper   i am glad you are come  for there is such fun here <EOS> <SOS>   what do you think has happened this morning <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins has made an offer to lizzy  and she will not have him <EOS> <SOS>   charlotte had hardly time to answer  before they were joined by kitty  who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room  where mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was alone  than she likewise began on the subject  calling on missucas for her compassion  and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family <EOS> <SOS>   pray do  my dear missucas   she added in a melancholy tone   for nobody is on my side  nobody takes part with me  i am cruelly used  nobody feels for my poor nerves <EOS> <SOS>   charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   aye  there she comes   continued mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   looking as unconcerned as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were at york  provided she can have her own way <EOS> <SOS>   but i tell you what  missizzy  if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way  you will never get a husband at all  and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead <EOS> <SOS>    i  shall not be able to keep you  and so i warn you <EOS> <SOS>   i have done with you from this very day <EOS> <SOS>   i told you in the library  you know  that i should never speak to you again  and you will find me as good as my word <EOS> <SOS>  i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children <EOS> <SOS>   not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body <EOS> <SOS>  people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking <EOS> <SOS>  nobody can tell what i suffer <EOS> <SOS>   but it is always so <EOS> <SOS>  those who do not complain are never pitied <EOS> <SOS>   her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation <EOS> <SOS>  she talked on  therefore  without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins  who entered with an air more stately than usual  and on perceiving whom  she said to the girls   now  i do insist upon it  that you  all of you  hold your tongues  and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  jane and kitty followed  but lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she could  and charlotte  detained first by the civility of mr collins  whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute  and then by a little curiosity  satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear <EOS> <SOS>  in a doleful voice mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet thus began the projected conversation <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins <EOS> <SOS>      my dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this point <EOS> <SOS>  far be it from me   he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your daughter <EOS> <SOS>  resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all  the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment  and i trust i am resigned <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation <EOS> <SOS>  you will not  i hope  consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour  without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf <EOS> <SOS>  my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own <EOS> <SOS>  but we are all liable to error <EOS> <SOS>  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair <EOS> <SOS>  my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with due consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my  manner  has been at all reprehensible  i here beg leave to apologise <EOS> <SOS>   chapter xxi <EOS> <SOS>  the discussion of mr collins s offer was now nearly at an end  and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it  and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother <EOS> <SOS>  as for the gentleman himself   his  feelings were chiefly expressed  not by embarrassment or dejection  or by trying to avoid her  but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence <EOS> <SOS>  he scarcely ever spoke to her  and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself  were transferred for the rest of the day to missucas  whose civility in listening to him  was a seasonable relief to them all  and especially to her friend <EOS> <SOS>  the morrow produced no abatement of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s ill humour or ill health <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it <EOS> <SOS>  he was always to have gone on saturday  and to saturday he still meant to stay <EOS> <SOS>  after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned  and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball <EOS> <SOS>  he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s  where his regret and vexation  and the concern of every body was well talked over <EOS> <SOS>   to elizabeth  however  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence  had  been self imposed <EOS> <SOS>   i found   said he   as the time drew near  that i had better not meet mr darcy   that to be in the same room  the same party with him for so many hours together  might be more than i could bear  and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself <EOS> <SOS>   she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a full discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn  and during the walk  he particularly attended to her <EOS> <SOS>  his accompanying them was a double advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother <EOS> <SOS>  soon after their return  a letter was delivered to missennet  it came from netherfield  and was opened immediately <EOS> <SOS>  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant  little  hot pressed paper  well covered with a lady s fair  flowing hand  and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it  and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages <EOS> <SOS>  jane recollected herself soon  and putting the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs <EOS> <SOS>  when they had gained their own room  jane taking out the letter  said   this is from caroline bingley  what it contains  has surprised me a good deal <EOS> <SOS>  the whole party have left netherfield by this time  and are on their way to town  and without any intention of coming back again <EOS> <SOS>  you shall hear what she says <EOS> <SOS>   she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly  and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street  where mr hurst had a house <EOS> <SOS>  the next was in these words <EOS> <SOS>   i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  but we will hope at some future period  to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known  and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence <EOS> <SOS>  i depend on you for that <EOS> <SOS>   to these high flown expressions  elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust  and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her  she saw nothing in it really to lament  it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley s being there  and as to the loss of their society  she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it  in the enjoyment of his <EOS> <SOS>   it is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country <EOS> <SOS>  but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which missingley looks forward  may arrive earlier than she is aware  and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends  will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters <EOS> <SOS>   mr bingley will not be detained in london by them <EOS> <SOS>    caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter <EOS> <SOS>  i will read it to you    when my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business which took him to london  might be concluded in three or four days  but as we are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town  he will be in no hurry to leave it again  we have determined on following him thither  that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel <EOS> <SOS>  many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter  i wish i could hear that you  my dearest friend  had any intention of making one in the croud  but of that i despair <EOS> <SOS>  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three  of whom we shall deprive you <EOS> <SOS>    it is evident by this   added jane   that he comes back no more this winter <EOS> <SOS>    it is only evident that missingley does not mean he  should  <EOS> <SOS>    why will you think so <EOS> <SOS>  it must be his own doing <EOS> <SOS>   he is his own master <EOS> <SOS>  but you do not know  all  <EOS> <SOS>  i  will  read you the passage which particularly hurts me <EOS> <SOS>  i will have no reserves from  you  <EOS> <SOS>    mr darcy is impatient to see his sister  and to confess the truth   we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again <EOS> <SOS>  i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  and accomplishments  and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself  is heightened into something still more interesting  from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister <EOS> <SOS>  i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject  but i will not leave the country without confiding them  and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable <EOS> <SOS>  my brother admires her greatly already  he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  her relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a sister s partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart <EOS> <SOS>  with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest jane  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many <EOS> <SOS>    what think you of  this  sentence  my dear lizzy <EOS> <SOS>    said jane as she finished it <EOS> <SOS>   is it not clear enough <EOS> <SOS>   does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister  that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him  she means  most kindly <EOS> <SOS>   to put me on my guard <EOS> <SOS>  can there be any other opinion on the subject <EOS> <SOS>    yes  there can  for mine is totally different <EOS> <SOS>   will you hear it <EOS> <SOS>    most willingly <EOS> <SOS>    you shall have it in few words <EOS> <SOS>  missingley sees that her brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry missarcy <EOS> <SOS>  she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you <EOS> <SOS>   jane shook her head <EOS> <SOS>   indeed  jane  you ought to believe me <EOS> <SOS>   no one who has ever seen you together  can doubt his affection <EOS> <SOS>  missingley i am sure cannot <EOS> <SOS>  she is not such a simpleton <EOS> <SOS>  could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself  she would have ordered her wedding clothes <EOS> <SOS>  but the case is this <EOS> <SOS>  we are not rich enough  or grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get missarcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been  one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and i dare say it would succeed  if misse bourgh were out of the way <EOS> <SOS>  but  my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because missingley tells you her brother greatly admires missarcy  he is in the smallest degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you  he is very much in love with her friend <EOS> <SOS>    if we thought alike of missingley   replied jane   your representation of all this  might make me quite easy <EOS> <SOS>  but i know the foundation is unjust <EOS> <SOS>  caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one  and all that i can hope in this case is  that she is deceived herself <EOS> <SOS>    that is right <EOS> <SOS>   you could not have started a more happy idea  since you will not take comfort in mine <EOS> <SOS>  believe her to be deceived by all means <EOS> <SOS>  you have now done your duty by her  and must fret no longer <EOS> <SOS>    but  my dear sister  can i be happy  even supposing the best  in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere <EOS> <SOS>    you must decide for yourself   said elizabeth   and if upon mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife  i advise you by all means to refuse him <EOS> <SOS>    how can you talk so <EOS> <SOS>    said jane faintly smiling    you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation  i could not hesitate <EOS> <SOS>    i did not think you would   and that being the case  i cannot consider your situation with much compassion <EOS> <SOS>    but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be required <EOS> <SOS>  a thousand things may arise in six months <EOS> <SOS>   the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt <EOS> <SOS>  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken  could influence a young man so totally independent of every one <EOS> <SOS>  she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect <EOS> <SOS>  jane s temper was not desponding  and she was gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope  that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart <EOS> <SOS>  they agreed that mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet should only hear of the departure of the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away  just as they were all getting so intimate together <EOS> <SOS>  after lamenting it however at some length  she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that  though he had been invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two full courses <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xxii <EOS> <SOS>  the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases  and again during the chief of the day  was missucas so kind as to listen to mr collins <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her <EOS> <SOS>   it keeps him in good humour   said she   and i am more obliged to you than i can express <EOS> <SOS>   charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time <EOS> <SOS>  this was very amiable  but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of   its object was nothing less  than to secure her from any return of mr collins s addresses  by engaging them towards herself <EOS> <SOS>  such was missucas s scheme  and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night  she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon <EOS> <SOS>  but here  she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness  and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet <EOS> <SOS>  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  from a conviction that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to conjecture his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise  for though feeling almost secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday <EOS> <SOS>  his reception however was of the most flattering kind <EOS> <SOS>  missucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane <EOS> <SOS>  but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there <EOS> <SOS>  in as short a time as mr collins s long speeches would allow  every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  and as they entered the house  he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present  the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness <EOS> <SOS>  the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature  must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and missucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment were gained <EOS> <SOS>  sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter  to whom they could give little fortune  and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair <EOS> <SOS>  lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before  how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion  that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st <EOS> <SOS>  james s <EOS> <SOS>  the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion <EOS> <SOS>  the younger girls formed hopes of  coming out  a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte herself was tolerably composed <EOS> <SOS>  she had gained her point  and had time to consider of it <EOS> <SOS>  her reflections were in general satisfactory <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his attachment to her must be imaginary <EOS> <SOS>  but still he would be her husband <EOS> <SOS>   without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony  marriage had always been her object  it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune  and however uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest preservative from want <EOS> <SOS>  this preservative she had now obtained  and at the age of twenty seven  without having ever been handsome  she felt all the good luck of it <EOS> <SOS>  the least agreeable circumstance in the business  was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth would wonder  and probably would blame her  and though her resolution was not to be shaken  her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation <EOS> <SOS>  she resolved to give her the information herself  and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family <EOS> <SOS>  a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence  burst forth in such very direct questions on his return  as required some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising great self denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous love <EOS> <SOS>  as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again  whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them <EOS> <SOS>   my dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible <EOS> <SOS>   they were all astonished  and mr bennet  who could by no means wish for so speedy a return  immediately said   but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here  my good sir <EOS> <SOS>   you had better neglect your relations  than run the risk of offending your patroness <EOS> <SOS>    my dear sir   replied mr collins   i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence <EOS> <SOS>    you cannot be too much on your guard <EOS> <SOS>  risk any thing rather than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again  which i should think exceedingly probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence <EOS> <SOS>    believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this  as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire <EOS> <SOS>  as for my fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness  not excepting my cousin elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls  and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him <EOS> <SOS>  she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s  he might become a very agreeable companion <EOS> <SOS>  but on the following morning  every hope of this kind was done away <EOS> <SOS>  missucas called soon after breakfast  and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before <EOS> <SOS>  the possibility of mr collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two  but that charlotte could encourage him  seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself  and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out   engaged to mr collins <EOS> <SOS>  my dear charlotte   impossible <EOS> <SOS>   the steady countenance which missucas had commanded in telling her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected  she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied   why should you be surprised  my dear eliza <EOS> <SOS>   do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with you <EOS> <SOS>   but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong effort for it  was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her  and that she wished her all imaginable happiness <EOS> <SOS>   i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte    you must be surprised  very much surprised   so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you <EOS> <SOS>  but when you have had time to think it all over  i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done <EOS> <SOS>  i am not romantic you know <EOS> <SOS>  i never was <EOS> <SOS>  i ask only a comfortable home  and considering mr collins s character  connections  and situation in life  i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair  as most people can boast on entering the marriage state <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth quietly answered  undoubtedly    and after an awkward pause  they returned to the rest of the family <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte did not stay much longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard <EOS> <SOS>  it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match <EOS> <SOS>  the strangeness of mr collins s making two offers of marriage within three days  was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted <EOS> <SOS>  she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own  but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte the wife of mr collins  was a most humiliating picture <EOS> <SOS>   and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xxiii <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on what she had heard  and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family <EOS> <SOS>  with many compliments to them  and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter   to an audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil  boisterously exclaimed   good lord <EOS> <SOS>  sir william  how can you tell such a story <EOS> <SOS>   do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy <EOS> <SOS>   nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment  but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters  by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william  in which she was readily joined by jane  and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match  the excellent character of mr collins  and the convenient distance of hunsford from london <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent <EOS> <SOS>  in the first place  she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter  secondly  she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in  thirdly  she trusted that they would never be happy together  and fourthly  that the match might be broken off <EOS> <SOS>  two inferences  however  were plainly deduced from the whole  one  that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief  and the other  that she herself had been barbarously used by them all  and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day <EOS> <SOS>  nothing could console and nothing appease her <EOS> <SOS>   nor did that day wear out her resentment <EOS> <SOS>  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude  and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion  and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that charlotte lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his daughter <EOS> <SOS>  jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable <EOS> <SOS>  kitty and lydia were far from envying missucas  for mr collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton <EOS> <SOS>  lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was  though mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away <EOS> <SOS>  between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again <EOS> <SOS>  her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious  as bingley had now been gone a week  and nothing was heard of his return <EOS> <SOS>  jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again <EOS> <SOS>  the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday  addressed to their father  and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted <EOS> <SOS>  after discharging his conscience on that head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour  missucas  and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible  which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>  on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband <EOS> <SOS>   it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome <EOS> <SOS>   she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent  and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable <EOS> <SOS>  such were the gentle murmurs of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley s continued absence <EOS> <SOS>  neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject <EOS> <SOS>  day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly incensed mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood <EOS> <SOS>  even elizabeth began to fear  not that bingley was indifferent  but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away <EOS> <SOS>  unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness  and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover  she could not prevent its frequently recurring <EOS> <SOS>  the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend  assisted by the attractions of missarcy and the amusements of london  might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his attachment <EOS> <SOS>  as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspence was  of course  more painful than elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing  and between herself and elizabeth  therefore  the subject was never alluded to <EOS> <SOS>  but as no such delicacy restrained her mother  an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley  express her impatience for his arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back  she should think herself very ill used <EOS> <SOS>  it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight  but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction <EOS> <SOS>  he was too happy  however  to need much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company <EOS> <SOS>  the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge  and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was really in a most pitiable state <EOS> <SOS>  the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour  and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of <EOS> <SOS>  the sight of missucas was odious to her <EOS> <SOS>  as her successor in that house  she regarded her with jealous abhorrence <EOS> <SOS>  whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins  was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr bennet were dead <EOS> <SOS>  she complained bitterly of all this to her husband <EOS> <SOS>   indeed  mr bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that i should be forced to make way for  her   and live to see her take my place in it <EOS> <SOS>    my dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts <EOS> <SOS>  let us hope for better things <EOS> <SOS>  let us flatter ourselves that  i  may be the survivor <EOS> <SOS>   this was not very consoling to mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  and  therefore  instead of making any answer  she went on as before   i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate <EOS> <SOS>  if it was not for the entail i should not mind it <EOS> <SOS>    what should not you mind <EOS> <SOS>    i should not mind any thing at all <EOS> <SOS>    let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility <EOS> <SOS>    i never can be thankful  mr bennet  for any thing about the entail <EOS> <SOS>  how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand  and all for the sake of mr collins too <EOS> <SOS>   why should  he  have it more than anybody else <EOS> <SOS>    i leave it to yourself to determine   said mr bennet <EOS> <SOS>  end of vol <EOS> <SOS>  i <EOS> <SOS>   illustration  a vicarage house <EOS> <SOS>   pride and prejudice  a novel <EOS> <SOS>  in three volumes <EOS> <SOS>  by

prejudice <EOS> <SOS>  chapter i <EOS> <SOS>  missingley s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt <EOS> <SOS>  the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter  and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country <EOS> <SOS>  hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter  she found little  except the professed affection of the writer  that could give her any comfort <EOS> <SOS>  missarcy s praise occupied the chief of it <EOS> <SOS>  her many attractions were again dwelt on  and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter <EOS> <SOS>  she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr darcy s house  and mentioned with raptures  some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this  heard it in silent indignation <EOS> <SOS>  her heart was divided between concern for her sister  and resentment against all the others <EOS> <SOS>  to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to missarcy she paid no credit <EOS> <SOS>  that he was really fond of jane  she doubted no more than she had ever done  and much as she had always been disposed to like him  she could not think without anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness of temper  that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends  and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations <EOS> <SOS>  had his own happiness  however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best  but her sister s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible himself <EOS> <SOS>  it was a subject  in short  on which reflection would be long indulged  and must be unavailing <EOS> <SOS>  she could think of nothing else  and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away  or were suppressed by his friends  interference  whether he had been aware of jane s attachment  or whether it had escaped his observation  whichever were the case  though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference  her sister s situation remained the same  her peace equally wounded <EOS> <SOS>  a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth  but at last on mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s leaving them together  after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master  she could not help saying   oh <EOS> <SOS>  that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him <EOS> <SOS>  but i will not repine <EOS> <SOS>  it cannot last long <EOS> <SOS>  he will be forgot  and we shall all be as we were before <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but said nothing <EOS> <SOS>   you doubt me   cried jane  slightly colouring   indeed you have no reason <EOS> <SOS>  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance  but that is all <EOS> <SOS>  i have nothing either to hope or fear  and nothing to reproach him with <EOS> <SOS>  thank god <EOS> <SOS>  i have not  that  pain <EOS> <SOS>  a little time therefore <EOS> <SOS>   i shall certainly try to get the better <EOS> <SOS>   with a stronger voice she soon added   i have this comfort immediately  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side  and that it has done no harm to any one but myself <EOS> <SOS>    my dear jane <EOS> <SOS>   exclaimed elizabeth   you are too good <EOS> <SOS>  your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic  i do not know what to say to you <EOS> <SOS>  i feel as if i had never done you justice  or loved you as you deserve <EOS> <SOS>   missennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection <EOS> <SOS>   nay   said elizabeth   this is not fair <EOS> <SOS>   you  wish to think all the world respectable  and are hurt if i speak ill of any body <EOS> <SOS>   i  only want to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself against it <EOS> <SOS>  do not be afraid of my running into any excess  of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will <EOS> <SOS>  you need not <EOS> <SOS>  there are few people whom i really love  and still fewer of whom i think well <EOS> <SOS>  the more i see of the world  the more am i dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense <EOS> <SOS>  i have met with two instances lately  one i will not mention  the other is charlotte s marriage <EOS> <SOS>  it is unaccountable <EOS> <SOS>  in every view it is unaccountable <EOS> <SOS>    my dear lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these <EOS> <SOS>  they will ruin your happiness <EOS> <SOS>  you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper <EOS> <SOS>  consider mr collins s respectability  and charlotte s prudent  steady character <EOS> <SOS>  remember that she is one of a large family  that as to fortune  it is a most eligible match  and be ready to believe  for every body s sake  that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin <EOS> <SOS>    to oblige you  i would try to believe almost any thing  but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him  i should only think worse of her understanding  than i now do of her heart <EOS> <SOS>  my dear jane  mr collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow minded  silly man  you know he is  as well as i do  and you must feel  as well as i do  that the woman who marries him  cannot have a proper way of thinking <EOS> <SOS>  you shall not defend her  though it is charlotte lucas <EOS> <SOS>  you shall not  for the sake of one individual  change the meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility of danger  security for happiness <EOS> <SOS>    i must think your language too strong in speaking of both   replied jane   and i hope you will be convinced of it  by seeing them happy together <EOS> <SOS>  but enough of this <EOS> <SOS>  you alluded to something else <EOS> <SOS>  you mentioned  two  instances <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot misunderstand you  but i intreat you  dear lizzy  not to pain me by thinking  that person  to blame  and saying your opinion of him is sunk <EOS> <SOS>  we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured <EOS> <SOS>  we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect <EOS> <SOS>  it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us <EOS> <SOS>  women fancy admiration means more than it does <EOS> <SOS>    and men take care that they should <EOS> <SOS>    if it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine <EOS> <SOS>    i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design   said elizabeth   but without scheming to do wrong  or to make others unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery <EOS> <SOS>  thoughtlessness  want of attention to other people s feelings  and want of resolution  will do the business <EOS> <SOS>    and do you impute it to either of those <EOS> <SOS>    yes  to the last <EOS> <SOS>  but if i go on  i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem <EOS> <SOS>  stop me whilst you can <EOS> <SOS>    you persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him <EOS> <SOS>    yes  in conjunction with his friend <EOS> <SOS>    i cannot believe it <EOS> <SOS>  why should they try to influence him <EOS> <SOS>  they can only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no other woman can secure it <EOS> <SOS>    your first position is false <EOS> <SOS>  they may wish many things besides his happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence  they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money  great connections  and pride <EOS> <SOS>    beyond a doubt  they  do  wish him to chuse missarcy   replied jane   but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing <EOS> <SOS>  they have known her much longer than they have known me  no wonder if they love her better <EOS> <SOS>  but  whatever may be their own wishes  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s <EOS> <SOS>  what sister would think herself at liberty to do it  unless there were something very objectionable <EOS> <SOS>  if they believed him attached to me  they would not try to part us  if he were so  they could not succeed <EOS> <SOS>  by supposing such an affection  you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most unhappy <EOS> <SOS>  do not distress me by the idea <EOS> <SOS>  i am not ashamed of having been mistaken  or  at least  it is slight  it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters <EOS> <SOS>  let me take it in the best light  in the light in which it may be understood <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time mr bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly  there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity <EOS> <SOS>  her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself  that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking  which ceased when he saw her no more  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time  she had the same story to repeat every day <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s best comfort was  that mr bingley must be down again in the summer <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet treated the matter differently <EOS> <SOS>   so  lizzy   said he one day   your sister is crossed in love i find <EOS> <SOS>  i congratulate her <EOS> <SOS>  next to being married  a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then <EOS> <SOS>  it is something to think of  and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions <EOS> <SOS>  when is your turn to come <EOS> <SOS>  you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane <EOS> <SOS>  now is your time <EOS> <SOS>  here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country <EOS> <SOS>  let wickham be  your  man <EOS> <SOS>  he is a pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably <EOS> <SOS>    thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me <EOS> <SOS>  we must not all expect jane s good fortune <EOS> <SOS>    true   said mr bennet   but it is a comfort to think that  whatever of that kind may befal you  you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it <EOS> <SOS>   mr wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom  which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family <EOS> <SOS>  they saw him often  and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve <EOS> <SOS>  the whole of what elizabeth had already heard  his claims on mr darcy  and all that he had suffered from him  was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter <EOS> <SOS>  missennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the society of hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes  but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men <EOS> <SOS>  chapter ii <EOS> <SOS>  after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity  mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday <EOS> <SOS>  the pain of separation  however  might be alleviated on his side  by preparations for the reception of his bride  as he had reason to hope  that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire  the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men <EOS> <SOS>  he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father another letter of thanks <EOS> <SOS>  on the following monday  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner was a sensible  gentleman like man  greatly superior to his sister  as well by nature as education <EOS> <SOS>  the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade  and within view of his own warehouses  could have been so well bred and agreeable <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  who was several years younger than mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant woman  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces <EOS> <SOS>  between the two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a very particular regard <EOS> <SOS>  they had frequently been staying with her in town <EOS> <SOS>  the first part of mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s business on her arrival  was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions <EOS> <SOS>  when this was done  she had a less active part to play <EOS> <SOS>  it became her turn to listen <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had many grievances to relate  and much to complain of <EOS> <SOS>  they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister <EOS> <SOS>  two of her girls had been on the point of marriage  and after all there was nothing in it <EOS> <SOS>   i do not blame jane   she continued   for jane would have got mr bingley  if she could <EOS> <SOS>  but  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  oh  sister <EOS> <SOS>  it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time  had not it been for her own perverseness <EOS> <SOS>  he made her an offer in this very room  and she refused him <EOS> <SOS>  the consequence of it is  that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have  and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever <EOS> <SOS>  the lucases are very artful people indeed  sister <EOS> <SOS>  they are all for what they can get <EOS> <SOS>  i am sorry to say it of them  but so it is <EOS> <SOS>  it makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted so in my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else <EOS> <SOS>  however  your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you tell us  of long sleeves <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given before  in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her  made her sister a slight answer  and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation <EOS> <SOS>  when alone with elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the subject <EOS> <SOS>   it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane   said she <EOS> <SOS>   i am sorry it went off <EOS> <SOS>  but these things happen so often <EOS> <SOS>  a young man  such as you describe mr bingley  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks  and when accident separates them  so easily forgets her  that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent <EOS> <SOS>    an excellent consolation in its way   said elizabeth   but it will not do for  us  <EOS> <SOS>  we do not suffer by  accident  <EOS> <SOS>  it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl  whom he was violently in love with only a few days before <EOS> <SOS>    but that expression of  violently in love  is so hackneyed  so doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea <EOS> <SOS>  it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance  as to a real  strong attachment <EOS> <SOS>  pray  how  violent was  mr bingley s love <EOS> <SOS>    i never saw a more promising inclination <EOS> <SOS>  he was growing quite inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her <EOS> <SOS>  every time they met  it was more decided and remarkable <EOS> <SOS>  at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to dance  and i spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an answer <EOS> <SOS>  could there be finer symptoms <EOS> <SOS>  is not general incivility the very essence of love <EOS> <SOS>    oh  yes <EOS> <SOS>   of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt <EOS> <SOS>  poor jane <EOS> <SOS>  i am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she may not get over it immediately <EOS> <SOS>  it had better have happened to  you   lizzy  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner <EOS> <SOS>  but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us <EOS> <SOS>  change of scene might be of service  and perhaps a little relief from home  may be as useful as anything <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence <EOS> <SOS>   i hope   added mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner   that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her <EOS> <SOS>  we live in so different a part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her <EOS> <SOS>    and  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of his friend  and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london <EOS> <SOS>  my dear aunt  how could you think of it <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy may perhaps have  heard  of such a place as gracechurch street  but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter it  and depend upon it  mr bingley never stirs without him <EOS> <SOS>    so much the better <EOS> <SOS>  i hope they will not meet at all <EOS> <SOS>  but does not jane correspond with the sister <EOS> <SOS>   she  will not be able to help calling <EOS> <SOS>    she will drop the acquaintance entirely <EOS> <SOS>   but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point  as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane  she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her  on examination  that she did not consider it entirely hopeless <EOS> <SOS>  it was possible  and sometimes she thought it probable  that his affection might be re animated  and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions <EOS> <SOS>  missennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time  than as she hoped that  by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without any danger of seeing him <EOS> <SOS>  the gardiners staid a week at longbourn  and what with the philipses  the lucases  and the officers  there was not a day without its engagement <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister  that they did not once sit down to a family dinner <EOS> <SOS>  when the engagement was for home  some of the officers always made part of it  of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one  and on these occasions  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him  narrowly observed them both <EOS> <SOS>  without supposing them  from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy  and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire  and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment <EOS> <SOS>  to mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  wickham had one means of affording pleasure  unconnected with his general powers <EOS> <SOS>  about ten or a dozen years ago  before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire  to which he belonged <EOS> <SOS>  they had  therefore  many acquaintance in common  and  though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father  five years before  it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends  than she had been in the way of procuring <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner had seen pemberley  and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well <EOS> <SOS>  here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse <EOS> <SOS>  in comparing her recollection of pemberley  with the minute description which wickham could give  and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor  she was delighting both him and herself <EOS> <SOS>  on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy s treatment of him  she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad  which might agree with it  and was confident at last  that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill natured boy <EOS> <SOS>  chapter iii <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone  after honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went on   you are too sensible a girl  lizzy  to fall in love merely because you are warned against it  and  therefore  i am not afraid of speaking openly <EOS> <SOS>  seriously  i would have you be on your guard <EOS> <SOS>  do not involve yourself  or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent <EOS> <SOS>  i have nothing to say against  him   he is a most interesting young man  and if he had the fortune he ought to have  i should think you could not do better <EOS> <SOS>  but as it is  you must not let your fancy run away with you <EOS> <SOS>  you have sense  and we all expect you to use it <EOS> <SOS>  your father would depend on  your  resolution and good conduct  i am sure <EOS> <SOS>  you must not disappoint your father <EOS> <SOS>    my dear aunt  this is being serious indeed <EOS> <SOS>    yes  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise <EOS> <SOS>    well  then  you need not be under any alarm <EOS> <SOS>  i will take care of myself  and of mr wickham too <EOS> <SOS>  he shall not be in love with me  if i can prevent it <EOS> <SOS>    elizabeth  you are not serious now <EOS> <SOS>    i beg your pardon <EOS> <SOS>  i will try again <EOS> <SOS>  at present i am not in love with mr wickham  no  i certainly am not <EOS> <SOS>  but he is  beyond all comparison  the most agreeable man i ever saw  and if he becomes really attached to me  i believe it will be better that he should not <EOS> <SOS>  i see the imprudence of it <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>   that  abominable mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  and i should be miserable to forfeit it <EOS> <SOS>  my father  however  is partial to mr wickham <EOS> <SOS>  in short  my dear aunt  i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy  but since we see every day that where there is affection  young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune  from entering into engagements with each other  how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted  or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist <EOS> <SOS>  all that i can promise you  therefore  is not to be in a hurry <EOS> <SOS>  i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object <EOS> <SOS>  when i am in company with him  i will not be wishing <EOS> <SOS>  in short  i will do my best <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps it will be as well  if you discourage his coming here so very often <EOS> <SOS>  at least  you should not  remind  your mother of inviting him <EOS> <SOS>    as i did the other day   said elizabeth  with a conscious smile   very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that  <EOS> <SOS>  but do not imagine that he is always here so often <EOS> <SOS>  it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week <EOS> <SOS>  you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends <EOS> <SOS>  but really  and upon my honour  i will try to do what i think to be wisest  and now  i hope you are satisfied <EOS> <SOS>   her aunt assured her that she was  and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point  without being resented <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane  but as he took up his abode with the lucases  his arrival was no great inconvenience to mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>  his marriage was now fast approaching  and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable  and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she   wished  they might be happy <EOS> <SOS>   thursday was to be the wedding day  and on wednesday missucas paid her farewell visit  and when she rose to take leave  elizabeth  ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself  accompanied her out of the room <EOS> <SOS>  as they went down stairs together  charlotte said   i shall depend on hearing from you very often  eliza <EOS> <SOS>     that  you certainly shall <EOS> <SOS>    and i have another favour to ask <EOS> <SOS>  will you come and see me <EOS> <SOS>    we shall often meet  i hope  in hertfordshire <EOS> <SOS>    i am not likely to leave kent for some time <EOS> <SOS>  promise me  therefore  to come to hunsford <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit <EOS> <SOS>   my father and maria are to come to me in march   added charlotte   and i hope you will consent to be of the party <EOS> <SOS>  indeed  eliza  you will be as welcome to me as either of them <EOS> <SOS>   the wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door  and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth soon heard from her friend  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been  that it should be equally unreserved was impossible <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over  and  though determined not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the sake of what had been  rather than what was <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she would like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen <EOS> <SOS>  she wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with comforts  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise <EOS> <SOS>  the house  furniture  neighbourhood  and roads  were all to her taste  and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging <EOS> <SOS>  it was mr collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there  to know the rest <EOS> <SOS>  jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys <EOS> <SOS>  her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is <EOS> <SOS>  jane had been a week in town  without either seeing or hearing from caroline <EOS> <SOS>  she accounted for it  however  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn  had by some accident been lost <EOS> <SOS>   my aunt   she continued   is going to morrow into that part of the town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street <EOS> <SOS>   she wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen missingley <EOS> <SOS>   i did not think caroline in spirits   were her words   but she was very glad to see me  and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london <EOS> <SOS>  i was right  therefore  my last letter had never reached her <EOS> <SOS>  i enquired after their brother  of course <EOS> <SOS>  he was well  but so much engaged with mr darcy  that they scarcely ever saw him <EOS> <SOS>  i found that missarcy was expected to dinner <EOS> <SOS>  i wish i could see her <EOS> <SOS>  my visit was not long  as caroline and mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst were going out <EOS> <SOS>  i dare say i shall soon see them here <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth shook her head over this letter <EOS> <SOS>  it convinced her  that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister s being in town <EOS> <SOS>  four weeks passed away  and jane saw nothing of him <EOS> <SOS>  she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it  but she could no longer be blind to missingley s inattention <EOS> <SOS>  after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight  and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her  the visitor did at last appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  the alteration of her manner  would allow jane to deceive herself no longer <EOS> <SOS>  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister  will prove what she felt <EOS> <SOS>        my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment  at my expence  when i confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in missingley s regard for me <EOS> <SOS>  but  my      dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not think me      obstinate if i still assert  that  considering what her behaviour      was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion <EOS> <SOS>  i do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me  but      if the same circumstances were to happen again  i am sure i should      be deceived again <EOS> <SOS>  caroline did not return my visit till yesterday       and not a note  not a line  did i receive in the mean time <EOS> <SOS>  when      she did come  it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it       she made a slight  formal  apology  for not calling before  said      not a word of wishing to see me again  and was in every respect so      altered a creature  that when she went away  i was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer <EOS> <SOS>  i pity  though i      cannot help blaming her <EOS> <SOS>  she was very wrong in singling me out as      she did  i can safely say  that every advance to intimacy began on      her side <EOS> <SOS>  but i pity her  because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong  and because i am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it <EOS> <SOS>  i need not explain myself farther  and      though  we  know this anxiety to be quite needless  yet if she      feels it  it will easily account for her behaviour to me  and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister  whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf  is natural and amiable <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot but wonder       however  at her having any such fears now  because  if he had at      all cared about me  we must have met long  long ago <EOS> <SOS>  he knows of my      being in town  i am certain  from something she said herself  and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking  as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to missarcy <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot      understand it <EOS> <SOS>  if i were not afraid of judging harshly  i should      be almost tempted to say  that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this <EOS> <SOS>  but i will endeavour to banish every painful      thought  and think only of what will make me happy  your affection       and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt <EOS> <SOS>  let me hear      from you very soon <EOS> <SOS>  missingley said something of his never      returning to netherfield again  of giving up the house  but not      with any certainty <EOS> <SOS>  we had better not mention it <EOS> <SOS>  i am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      hunsford <EOS> <SOS>  pray go to see them  with sir william and maria <EOS> <SOS>  i am      sure you will be very comfortable there <EOS> <SOS>        your s   c <EOS> <SOS>   this letter gave elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped  by the sister at least <EOS> <SOS>  all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over <EOS> <SOS>  she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions <EOS> <SOS>  his character sunk on every review of it  and as a punishment for him  as well as a possible advantage to jane  she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy s sister  as  by wickham s account  she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman  and required information  and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself <EOS> <SOS>  his apparent partiality had subsided  his attentions were over  he was the admirer of some one else <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all  but she could see it and write of it without material pain <EOS> <SOS>  her heart had been but slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied with believing that  she  would have been his only choice  had fortune permitted it <EOS> <SOS>  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady  to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s  did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence <EOS> <SOS>  nothing  on the contrary  could be more natural  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her  she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both  and could very sincerely wish him happy <EOS> <SOS>  all this was acknowledged to mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  and after relating the circumstances  she thus went on    i am now convinced  my dear aunt  that i have never been much in love  for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion  i should at present detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil <EOS> <SOS>  but my feelings are not only cordial towards  him   they are even impartial towards missing <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot find out that i hate her at all  or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl <EOS> <SOS>  there can be no love in all this <EOS> <SOS>  my watchfulness has been effectual  and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance  were i distractedly in love with him  i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance <EOS> <SOS>  importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly <EOS> <SOS>  kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do <EOS> <SOS>  they are young in the ways of the world  and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on  as well as the plain <EOS> <SOS>   chapter iv <EOS> <SOS>  with no greater events than these in the longbourn family  and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton  sometimes dirty and sometimes cold  did january and february pass away <EOS> <SOS>  march was to take elizabeth to hunsford <EOS> <SOS>  she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither  but charlotte  she soon found  was depending on the plan  and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty <EOS> <SOS>  absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again  and weakened her disgust of mr collins <EOS> <SOS>  there was novelty in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake <EOS> <SOS>  the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew near  she would have been very sorry for any delay <EOS> <SOS>  every thing  however  went on smoothly  and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch <EOS> <SOS>  she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter <EOS> <SOS>  the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time  and the plan became perfect as plan could be <EOS> <SOS>  the only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss her  and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her going  that he told her to write to him  and almost promised to answer her letter <EOS> <SOS>  the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly  on his side even more <EOS> <SOS>  his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention  the first to listen and to pity  the first to be admired  and in his manner of bidding her adieu  wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their opinion of her  their opinion of every body  would always coincide  there was a solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced  that whether married or single  he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing <EOS> <SOS>  her fellow travellers the next day  were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable <EOS> <SOS>  sir william lucas  and his daughter maria  a good humoured girl  but as empty headed as himself  had nothing to say that could be worth hearing  and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth loved absurdities  but she had known sir william s too long <EOS> <SOS>  he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood  and his civilities were worn out like his information <EOS> <SOS>  it was a journey of only twenty four miles  and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon <EOS> <SOS>  as they drove to mr gardiner s door  jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival  when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them  and elizabeth  looking earnestly in her face  was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever <EOS> <SOS>  on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls  whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower <EOS> <SOS>  all was joy and kindness <EOS> <SOS>  the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in bustle and shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt <EOS> <SOS>  their first subject was her sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear  in reply to her minute enquiries  that though jane always struggled to support her spirits  there were periods of dejection <EOS> <SOS>  it was reasonable  however  to hope  that they would not continue long <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner gave her the particulars also of missingley s visit in gracechurch street  and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given up the acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion  and complimented her on bearing it so well <EOS> <SOS>   but  my dear elizabeth   she added   what sort of girl is missing <EOS> <SOS>  i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary <EOS> <SOS>    pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial affairs  between the mercenary and the prudent motive <EOS> <SOS>  where does discretion end  and avarice begin <EOS> <SOS>  last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent  and now  because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds  you want to find out that he is mercenary <EOS> <SOS>    if you will only tell me what sort of girl missing is  i shall know what to think <EOS> <SOS>    she is a very good kind of girl  i believe <EOS> <SOS>  i know no harm of her <EOS> <SOS>    but he paid her not the smallest attention  till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune <EOS> <SOS>    no  why should he <EOS> <SOS>  if it was not allowable for him to gain  my  affections  because i had no money  what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was equally poor <EOS> <SOS>    but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her  so soon after this event <EOS> <SOS>    a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe <EOS> <SOS>  if  she  does not object to it  why should  we  <EOS> <SOS>     her  not objecting  does not justify  him  <EOS> <SOS>  it only shews her being deficient in something herself  sense or feeling <EOS> <SOS>    well   cried elizabeth   have it as you choose <EOS> <SOS>   he  shall be mercenary  and  she  shall be foolish <EOS> <SOS>    no  lizzy  that is what i do  not  choose <EOS> <SOS>  i should be sorry  you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  if that is all  i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better <EOS> <SOS>  i am sick of them all <EOS> <SOS>  thank heaven <EOS> <SOS>  i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality  who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him <EOS> <SOS>  stupid men are the only ones worth knowing  after all <EOS> <SOS>    take care  lizzy  that speech savours strongly of disappointment <EOS> <SOS>   before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer <EOS> <SOS>   we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner   but perhaps to the lakes <EOS> <SOS>   no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth  and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful <EOS> <SOS>   my dear  dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight <EOS> <SOS>  what felicity <EOS> <SOS>  you give me fresh life and vigour <EOS> <SOS>  adieu to disappointment and spleen <EOS> <SOS>  what are men to rocks and mountains <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  what hours of transport we shall spend <EOS> <SOS>  and when we  do  return  it shall not be like other travellers  without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing <EOS> <SOS>  we  will  know where we have gone  we  will  recollect what we have seen <EOS> <SOS>  lakes  mountains  and rivers  shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations  nor  when we attempt to describe any particular scene  will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation <EOS> <SOS>  let  our  first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers <EOS> <SOS>   chapter v <EOS> <SOS>  every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment  for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight <EOS> <SOS>  when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford  every eye was in search of the parsonage  and every turning expected to bring it in view <EOS> <SOS>  the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants <EOS> <SOS>  at length the parsonage was discernible <EOS> <SOS>  the garden sloping to the road  the house standing in it  the green pales and the laurel hedge  every thing declared they were arriving <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at the small gate  which led by a short gravel walk to the house  amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party <EOS> <SOS>  in a moment they were all out of the chaise  rejoicing at the sight of each other <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming  when she found herself so affectionately received <EOS> <SOS>  she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage  his formal civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family <EOS> <SOS>  they were then  with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as soon as they were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode  and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room  its aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself particularly to her  as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him <EOS> <SOS>  but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air  with such a companion <EOS> <SOS>  when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte <EOS> <SOS>  once or twice she could discern a faint blush  but in general charlotte wisely did not hear <EOS> <SOS>  after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room  from the sideboard to the fender  to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london  mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden  which was large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of which he attended himself <EOS> <SOS>  to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible <EOS> <SOS>  here  leading the way through every walk and cross walk  and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind <EOS> <SOS>  he could number the fields in every direction  and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump <EOS> <SOS>  but of all the views which his garden  or which the country  or the kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house <EOS> <SOS>  it was a handsome modern building  well situated on rising ground <EOS> <SOS>  from his garden  mr collins would have led them round his two meadows  but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost  turned back  and while sir william accompanied him  charlotte took her sister and friend over the house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help <EOS> <SOS>  it was rather small  but well built and convenient  and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit <EOS> <SOS>  when mr collins could be forgotten  there was really a great air of comfort throughout  and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten <EOS> <SOS>  she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country <EOS> <SOS>  it was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when mr collins joining in  observed   yes  misslizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church  and i need not say you will be delighted with her <EOS> <SOS>  she is all affability and condescension  and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over <EOS> <SOS>  i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here <EOS> <SOS>  her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming <EOS> <SOS>  we dine at rosings twice every week  and are never allowed to walk home <EOS> <SOS>  her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us <EOS> <SOS>  i  should  say  one of her ladyship s carriages  for she has several <EOS> <SOS>    lady catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed   added charlotte   and a most attentive neighbour <EOS> <SOS>    very true  my dear  that is exactly what i say <EOS> <SOS>  she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference <EOS> <SOS>   the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news  and telling again what had been already written  and when it closed  elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with her husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well <EOS> <SOS>  she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass  the quiet tenor of their usual employments  the vexatious interruptions of mr collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings <EOS> <SOS>  a lively imagination soon settled it all <EOS> <SOS>  about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting ready for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion  and after listening a moment  she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly after her <EOS> <SOS>  she opened the door  and met maria in the landing place  who  breathless with agitation  cried out   oh  my dear eliza <EOS> <SOS>  pray make haste and come into the dining room  for there is such a sight to be seen <EOS> <SOS>  i will not tell you what it is <EOS> <SOS>  make haste  and come down this moment <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing more  and down they ran into the dining room  which fronted the lane  in quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate <EOS> <SOS>   and is this all <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden  and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter <EOS> <SOS>    la <EOS> <SOS>  my dear   said maria quite shocked at the mistake   it is not lady catherine <EOS> <SOS>  the old lady is mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson  who lives with them <EOS> <SOS>  the other is misse bourgh <EOS> <SOS>  only look at her <EOS> <SOS>  she is quite a little creature <EOS> <SOS>  who would have thought she could be so thin and small <EOS> <SOS>    she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind <EOS> <SOS>  why does she not come in <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte says  she hardly ever does <EOS> <SOS>  it is the greatest of favours when misse bourgh comes in <EOS> <SOS>    i like her appearance   said elizabeth  struck with other ideas <EOS> <SOS>   she looks sickly and cross <EOS> <SOS>   yes  she will do for him very well <EOS> <SOS>  she will make him a very proper wife <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth s high diversion  was stationed in the doorway  in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him  and constantly bowing whenever misse bourgh looked that way <EOS> <SOS>  at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on  and the others returned into the house <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune  which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day <EOS> <SOS>  chapter vi <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete <EOS> <SOS>  the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors  and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife  was exactly what he had wished for  and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon  was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough <EOS> <SOS>   i confess   said he   that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings <EOS> <SOS>  i rather expected  from my knowledge of her affability  that it would happen <EOS> <SOS>  but who could have foreseen such an attention as this <EOS> <SOS>  who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an invitation moreover including the whole party  so immediately after your arrival <EOS> <SOS>    i am the less surprised at what has happened   replied sir william   from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire <EOS> <SOS>  about the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon <EOS> <SOS>   scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning  but their visit to rosings <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms  so many servants  and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them <EOS> <SOS>  when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to elizabeth   do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us  which becomes herself and daughter <EOS> <SOS>  i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest  there is no occasion for any thing more <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed <EOS> <SOS>  she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved <EOS> <SOS>   while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their different doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner <EOS> <SOS>   such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of living  quite frightened maria lucas  who had been little used to company  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings  with as much apprehension  as her father had done to his presentation at st <EOS> <SOS>  james s <EOS> <SOS>  as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park <EOS> <SOS>   every park has its beauty and its prospects  and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house  and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh <EOS> <SOS>  when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria s alarm was every moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly calm <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth s courage did not fail her <EOS> <SOS>  she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money and rank  she thought she could witness without trepidation <EOS> <SOS>  from the entrance hall  of which mr collins pointed out  with a rapturous air  the fine proportion and finished ornaments  they followed the servants through an anti chamber  to the room where lady catherine  her daughter  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson were sitting <EOS> <SOS>   her ladyship  with great condescension  arose to receive them  and as mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s  it was performed in a proper manner  without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary <EOS> <SOS>  in spite of having been at st <EOS> <SOS>  james s  sir william was so completely awed  by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat without saying a word  and his daughter  frightened almost out of her senses  sat on the edge of her chair  not knowing which way to look <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene  and could observe the three ladies before her composedly <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly marked features  which might once have been handsome <EOS> <SOS>  her air was not conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them  such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank <EOS> <SOS>  she was not rendered formidable by silence  but whatever she said  was spoken in so authoritative a tone  as marked her self importance  and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind  and from the observation of the day altogether  she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented <EOS> <SOS>  when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy  she turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment  at her being so thin  and so small <EOS> <SOS>  there was neither in figure nor face  any likeness between the ladies <EOS> <SOS>  misse bourgh was pale and sickly  her features  though not plain  were insignificant  and she spoke very little  except in a low voice  to mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson  in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes <EOS> <SOS>  after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the windows  to admire the view  mr collins attending them to point out its beauties  and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer <EOS> <SOS>  the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the servants  and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised  and  as he had likewise foretold  he took his seat at the bottom of the table  by her ladyship s desire  and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater <EOS> <SOS>   he carved  and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was commended  first by him  and then by sir william  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said  in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear <EOS> <SOS>  but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration  and gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them <EOS> <SOS>  the party did not supply much conversation <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening  but she was seated between charlotte and misse bourgh  the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little misse bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing she were indisposed <EOS> <SOS>  maria thought speaking out of the question  and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire <EOS> <SOS>  when the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted <EOS> <SOS>  she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely  and gave her a great deal of advice  as to the management of them all  told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention  which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others <EOS> <SOS>  in the intervals of her discourse with mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she knew the least  and who she observed to mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  was a very genteel  pretty kind of girl <EOS> <SOS>  she asked her at different times  how many sisters she had  whether they were older or younger than herself  whether any of them were likely to be married  whether they were handsome  where they had been educated  what carriage her father kept  and what had been her mother s maiden name <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions  but answered them very composedly <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine then observed   your father s estate is entailed on mr collins  i think <EOS> <SOS>  for your sake   turning to charlotte   i am glad of it  but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line <EOS> <SOS>   it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family <EOS> <SOS>   do you play and sing  missennet <EOS> <SOS>    a little <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  then  some time or other we shall be happy to hear you <EOS> <SOS>  our instrument is a capital one  probably superior to    you shall try it some day <EOS> <SOS>   do your sisters play and sing <EOS> <SOS>    one of them does <EOS> <SOS>    why did not you all learn <EOS> <SOS>   you ought all to have learned <EOS> <SOS>  the missebbs all play  and their father has not so good an income as your s <EOS> <SOS>   do you draw <EOS> <SOS>    no  not at all <EOS> <SOS>    what  none of you <EOS> <SOS>    not one <EOS> <SOS>    that is very strange <EOS> <SOS>  but i suppose you had no opportunity <EOS> <SOS>  your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters <EOS> <SOS>    my mother would have had no objection  but my father hates london <EOS> <SOS>    has your governess left you <EOS> <SOS>    we never had any governess <EOS> <SOS>    no governess <EOS> <SOS>  how was that possible <EOS> <SOS>  five daughters brought up at home without a governess <EOS> <SOS>   i never heard of such a thing <EOS> <SOS>  your mother must have been quite a slave to your education <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could hardly help smiling  as she assured her that had not been the case <EOS> <SOS>   then  who taught you <EOS> <SOS>  who attended to you <EOS> <SOS>  without a governess you must have been neglected <EOS> <SOS>    compared with some families  i believe we were  but such of us as wished to learn  never wanted the means <EOS> <SOS>  we were always encouraged to read  and had all the masters that were necessary <EOS> <SOS>  those who chose to be idle  certainly might <EOS> <SOS>    aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if i had known your mother  i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one <EOS> <SOS>  i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction  and nobody but a governess can give it <EOS> <SOS>  it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way <EOS> <SOS>  i am always glad to get a young person well placed out <EOS> <SOS>  four nieces of mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means  and it was but the other day  that i recommended another young person  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the family are quite delighted with her <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me <EOS> <SOS>  she finds missope a treasure <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine   said she   you have given me a treasure <EOS> <SOS>   are any of your younger sisters out  missennet <EOS> <SOS>    yes  ma am  all <EOS> <SOS>    all <EOS> <SOS>   what  all five out at once <EOS> <SOS>  very odd <EOS> <SOS>   and you only the second <EOS> <SOS>   the younger ones out before the elder are married <EOS> <SOS>   your younger sisters must be very young <EOS> <SOS>    yes  my youngest is not sixteen <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps  she  is full young to be much in company <EOS> <SOS>  but really  ma am  i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters  that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early <EOS> <SOS>   the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth  as the first <EOS> <SOS>  and to be kept back on  such  a motive <EOS> <SOS>   i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind <EOS> <SOS>    upon my word   said her ladyship   you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person <EOS> <SOS>   pray  what is your age <EOS> <SOS>    with three younger sisters grown up   replied elizabeth smiling   your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer  and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence <EOS> <SOS>   you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure   therefore you need not conceal your age <EOS> <SOS>    i am not one and twenty <EOS> <SOS>   when the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the card tables were placed <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine  sir william  and mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins sat down to quadrille  and as misse bourgh chose to play at cassino  the two girls had the honour of assisting mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson to make up her party <EOS> <SOS>  their table was superlatively stupid <EOS> <SOS>  scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game  except when mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson expressed her fears of misse bourgh s being too hot or too cold  or having too much or too little light <EOS> <SOS>  a great deal more passed at the other table <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine was generally speaking  stating the mistakes of the three others  or relating some anecdote of herself <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said  thanking her for every fish he won  and apologising if he thought he won too many <EOS> <SOS>  sir william did not say much <EOS> <SOS>  he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names <EOS> <SOS>  when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose  the tables were broke up  the carriage was offered to mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  gratefully accepted  and immediately ordered <EOS> <SOS>  the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow <EOS> <SOS>  from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins s side  and as many bows on sir william s  they departed <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her cousin  to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings  which  for charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it really was <EOS> <SOS>  but her commendation  though costing her some trouble  could by no means satisfy mr collins  and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands <EOS> <SOS>  chapter vii <EOS> <SOS>  sir william staid only a week at hunsford  but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with <EOS> <SOS>  while sir william was with them  mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig  and shewing him the country  but when he went away  the whole family returned to their usual employments  and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden  or in reading and writing  and looking out of window in his own book room  which fronted the road <EOS> <SOS>  the room in which the ladies sat was backwards <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use  it was a better sized room  and had a pleasanter aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did  for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally lively  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement <EOS> <SOS>  from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane  and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along  and how often especially misse bourgh drove by in her phaeton  which he never failed coming to inform them of  though it happened almost every day <EOS> <SOS>  she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and had a few minutes  conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out <EOS> <SOS>  very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise  and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours <EOS> <SOS>  now and then  they were honoured with a call from her ladyship  and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits <EOS> <SOS>  she examined into their employments  looked at their work  and advised them to do it differently  found fault with the arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins s joints of meat were too large for her family <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county  she was a most active magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented or too poor  she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences  silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty <EOS> <SOS>  the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week  and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being only one card table in the evening  every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first <EOS> <SOS>  their other engagements were few  as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general  was beyond the collinses  reach <EOS> <SOS>  this however was no evil to elizabeth  and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte  and the weather was so fine for the time of year  that she had often great enjoyment out of doors <EOS> <SOS>  her favourite walk  and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine  was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity <EOS> <SOS>  in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away <EOS> <SOS>  easter was approaching  and the week preceding it  was to bring an addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a circle must be important <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival  that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties  and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless missingley s designs on him were  by his behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration  and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by missucas and herself <EOS> <SOS>  his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park  hurried home with the great intelligence <EOS> <SOS>  on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects <EOS> <SOS>  there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of his uncle  lord      and to the great surprise of all the party  when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte had seen them from her husband s room  crossing the road  and immediately running into the other  told the girls what an honour they might expect  adding   i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment  before their approach was announced by the door bell  and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam  who led the way  was about thirty  not handsome  but in person and address most truly the gentleman <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  paid his compliments  with his usual reserve  to mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend  met her with every appearance of composure <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth merely curtseyed to him  without saying a word <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  sat for some time without speaking to any body <EOS> <SOS>  at length  however  his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family <EOS> <SOS>  she answered him in the usual way  and after a moment s pause  added   my eldest sister has been in town these three months <EOS> <SOS>  have you never happened to see her there <EOS> <SOS>   she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet missennet <EOS> <SOS>  the subject was pursued no farther  and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away <EOS> <SOS>  chapter viii <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings <EOS> <SOS>  it was some days  however  before they received any invitation thither  for while there were visitors in the house  they could not be necessary  and it was not till easter day  almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by such an attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening <EOS> <SOS>  for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time  but mr darcy they had only seen at church <EOS> <SOS>  the invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room <EOS> <SOS>  her ladyship received them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she was  in fact  almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them  especially to darcy  much more than to any other person in the room <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much <EOS> <SOS>  he now seated himself by her  and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire  of travelling and staying at home  of new books and music  that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before  and they conversed with so much spirit and flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself  as well as of mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged  for she did not scruple to call out   what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam <EOS> <SOS>  what is it you are talking of <EOS> <SOS>  what are you telling missennet <EOS> <SOS>  let me hear what it is <EOS> <SOS>    we are speaking of music  madam   said he  when no longer able to avoid a reply <EOS> <SOS>   of music <EOS> <SOS>  then pray speak aloud <EOS> <SOS>  it is of all subjects my delight <EOS> <SOS>  i must have my share in the conversation  if you are speaking of music <EOS> <SOS>  there are few people in england  i suppose  who have more true enjoyment of music than myself  or a better natural taste <EOS> <SOS>  if i had ever learnt  i should have been a great proficient <EOS> <SOS>  and so would anne  if her health had allowed her to apply <EOS> <SOS>  i am confident that she would have performed delightfully <EOS> <SOS>  how does georgiana get on  darcy <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency <EOS> <SOS>   i am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said lady catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to excel  if she does not practise a great deal <EOS> <SOS>    i assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such advice <EOS> <SOS>  she practises very constantly <EOS> <SOS>    so much the better <EOS> <SOS>  it cannot be done too much  and when i next write to her  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account <EOS> <SOS>  i often tell young ladies  that no excellence in music is to be acquired  without constant practice <EOS> <SOS>  i have told missennet several times  that she will never play really well  unless she practises more  and though mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins has no instrument  she is very welcome  as i have often told her  to come to rosings every day  and play on the piano forte in mr <EOS> <SOS>  jenkinson s room <EOS> <SOS>  she would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part of the house <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding  and made no answer <EOS> <SOS>  when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the instrument <EOS> <SOS>  he drew a chair near her <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine listened to half a song  and then talked  as before  to her other nephew  till the latter walked away from her  and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte  stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first convenient pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said   you mean to frighten me  mr darcy  by coming in all this state to hear me <EOS> <SOS>  but i will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play so well <EOS> <SOS>  there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others <EOS> <SOS>  my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me <EOS> <SOS>    i shall not say that you are mistaken   he replied   because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know  that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said to colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word i say <EOS> <SOS>  i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character  in a part of the world  where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit <EOS> <SOS>  indeed  mr darcy  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire  and  give me leave to say  very impolitic too  for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such things may come out  as will shock your relations to hear <EOS> <SOS>    i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly <EOS> <SOS>   pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried colonel fitzwilliam <EOS> <SOS>   i should like to know how he behaves among strangers <EOS> <SOS>    you shall hear then  but prepare yourself for something very dreadful <EOS> <SOS>  the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire  you must know  was at a ball  and at this ball  what do you think he did <EOS> <SOS>  he danced only four dances <EOS> <SOS>  i am sorry to pain you  but so it was <EOS> <SOS>  he danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce  and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy  you cannot deny the fact <EOS> <SOS>    i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party <EOS> <SOS>    true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room <EOS> <SOS>  well  colonel fitzwilliam  what do i play next <EOS> <SOS>  my fingers wait your orders <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps   said darcy   i should have judged better  had i sought an introduction  but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers <EOS> <SOS>    shall we ask your cousin the reason of this <EOS> <SOS>   said elizabeth  still addressing colonel fitzwilliam <EOS> <SOS>   shall we ask him why a man of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers <EOS> <SOS>    i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying to him <EOS> <SOS>  it is because he will not give himself the trouble <EOS> <SOS>    i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said darcy   of conversing easily with those i have never seen before <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested in their concerns  as i often see done <EOS> <SOS>    my fingers   said elizabeth   do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do <EOS> <SOS>  they have not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same expression <EOS> <SOS>  but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault  because i would not take the trouble of practising <EOS> <SOS>  it is not that i do not believe  my  fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution <EOS> <SOS>   darcy smiled and said   you are perfectly right <EOS> <SOS>  you have employed your time much better <EOS> <SOS>  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you  can think any thing wanting <EOS> <SOS>  we neither of us perform to strangers <EOS> <SOS>   here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to know what they were talking of <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth immediately began playing again <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine approached  and  after listening for a few minutes  said to darcy   missennet would not play at all amiss  if she practised more  and could have the advantage of a london master <EOS> <SOS>  she has a very good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to anne s <EOS> <SOS>  anne would have been a delightful performer  had her health allowed her to learn <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his behaviour to misse bourgh she derived this comfort for missingley  that he might have been just as likely to marry  her   had she been his relation <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance  mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility  and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home <EOS> <SOS>  chapter ix <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to jane  while mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins and maria were gone on business into the village  when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain signal of a visitor <EOS> <SOS>  as she had heard no carriage  she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and to her very great surprise  mr darcy  and mr darcy only  entered the room <EOS> <SOS>  he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for his intrusion  by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within <EOS> <SOS>  they then sat down  and when her enquiries after rosings were made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence <EOS> <SOS>  it was absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in this emergence recollecting  when  she had seen him last in hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure  she observed   how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he went but the day before <EOS> <SOS>  he and his sisters were well  i hope  when you left london <EOS> <SOS>    perfectly so  i thank you <EOS> <SOS>   she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a short pause  added   i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again <EOS> <SOS>    i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future <EOS> <SOS>  he has many friends  and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing <EOS> <SOS>    if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  for then we might possibly get a settled family there <EOS> <SOS>  but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle <EOS> <SOS>    i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it up  as soon as any eligible purchase offers <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth made no answer <EOS> <SOS>  she was afraid of talking longer of his friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him <EOS> <SOS>  he took the hint  and soon began with   this seems a very comfortable house <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford <EOS> <SOS>    i believe she did  and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object <EOS> <SOS>    mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife <EOS> <SOS>    yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him  or have made him happy if they had <EOS> <SOS>  my friend has an excellent understanding  though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did <EOS> <SOS>  she seems perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light  it is certainly a very good match for her <EOS> <SOS>    it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends <EOS> <SOS>    an easy distance do you call it <EOS> <SOS>  it is nearly fifty miles <EOS> <SOS>    and what is fifty miles of good road <EOS> <SOS>  little more than half a day s journey <EOS> <SOS>  yes  i call it a  very  easy distance <EOS> <SOS>    i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages  of the match   cried elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   i should never have said mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins was settled  near  her family <EOS> <SOS>    it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire <EOS> <SOS>  any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would appear far <EOS> <SOS>   as he spoke there was a sort of smile  which elizabeth fancied she understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield  and she blushed as she answered   i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family <EOS> <SOS>  the far and the near must be relative  and depend on many varying circumstances <EOS> <SOS>  where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil <EOS> <SOS>  but that is not the case  here  <EOS> <SOS>  mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins have a comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys  and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself  near  her family under less than  half  the present distance <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said    you  cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment <EOS> <SOS>   you  cannot have been always at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth looked surprised <EOS> <SOS>  the gentleman experienced some change of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the table  and  glancing over it  said  in a colder voice   are you pleased with kent <EOS> <SOS>   a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either side calm and concise  and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister  just returned from their walk <EOS> <SOS>  the t te   t te surprised them <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on missennet  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body  went away <EOS> <SOS>   what can be the meaning of this <EOS> <SOS>   said charlotte  as soon as he was gone <EOS> <SOS>   my dear eliza he must be in love with you  or he would never have called on us in this familiar way <EOS> <SOS>   but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very likely  even to charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do  which was the more probable from the time of year <EOS> <SOS>  all field sports were over <EOS> <SOS>  within doors there was lady catherine  books  and a billiard table  but gentlemen cannot be always within doors  and in the nearness of the parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day <EOS> <SOS>  they called at various times of the morning  sometimes separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by their aunt <EOS> <SOS>  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which of course recommended him still more  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his evident admiration of her  of her former favourite george wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners  she believed he might have the best informed mind <EOS> <SOS>  but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more difficult to understand <EOS> <SOS>  it could not be for society  as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice  a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to himself <EOS> <SOS>  he seldom appeared really animated <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins knew not what to make of him <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was generally different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told her  and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love  and the object of that love  her friend eliza  she sat herself seriously to work to find it out <EOS> <SOS>   she watched him whenever they were at rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford  but without much success <EOS> <SOS>  he certainly looked at her friend a great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable <EOS> <SOS>  it was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind <EOS> <SOS>  she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the idea  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins did not think it right to press the subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt  that all her friend s dislike would vanish  if she could suppose him to be in her power <EOS> <SOS>  in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam <EOS> <SOS>  he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin could have none at all <EOS> <SOS>  chapter x <EOS> <SOS>  more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park  unexpectedly meet mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  and to prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him at first  that it was a favourite haunt of hers <EOS> <SOS>   how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd <EOS> <SOS>   yet it did  and even a third <EOS> <SOS>  it seemed like wilful ill nature  or a voluntary penance  for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away  but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her <EOS> <SOS>  he never said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions  about her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of solitary walks  and her opinion of mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins s happiness  and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house  he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying  there  too <EOS> <SOS>  his words seemed to imply it <EOS> <SOS>  could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts <EOS> <SOS>  she supposed  if he meant any thing  he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter <EOS> <SOS>  it distressed her a little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage <EOS> <SOS>  she was engaged one day as she walked  in re perusing jane s last letter  and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by mr darcy  she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her <EOS> <SOS>  putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile  she said   i did not know before that you ever walked this way <EOS> <SOS>    i have been making the tour of the park   he replied   as i generally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage <EOS> <SOS>  are you going much farther <EOS> <SOS>    no  i should have turned in a moment <EOS> <SOS>   and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the parsonage together <EOS> <SOS>   do you certainly leave kent on saturday <EOS> <SOS>   said she <EOS> <SOS>   yes  if darcy does not put it off again <EOS> <SOS>  but i am at his disposal <EOS> <SOS>  he arranges the business just as he pleases <EOS> <SOS>    and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice <EOS> <SOS>  i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>    he likes to have his own way very well   replied colonel fitzwilliam <EOS> <SOS>   but so we all do <EOS> <SOS>  it is only that he has better means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor <EOS> <SOS>  i speak feelingly <EOS> <SOS>  a younger son  you know  must be inured to self denial and dependence <EOS> <SOS>    in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little of either <EOS> <SOS>  now  seriously  what have you ever known of self denial and dependence <EOS> <SOS>  when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose  or procuring any thing you had a fancy for <EOS> <SOS>    these are home questions  and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature <EOS> <SOS>  but in matters of greater weight  i may suffer from the want of money <EOS> <SOS>  younger sons cannot marry where they like <EOS> <SOS>    unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very often do <EOS> <SOS>    our habits of expence make us too dependant  and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money <EOS> <SOS>    is this   thought elizabeth   meant for me <EOS> <SOS>   and she coloured at the idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   and pray  what is the usual price of an earl s younger son <EOS> <SOS>  unless the elder brother is very sickly  i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>   he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped <EOS> <SOS>  to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed  she soon afterwards said   i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal <EOS> <SOS>  i wonder he does not marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind <EOS> <SOS>  but  perhaps his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her <EOS> <SOS>    no   said colonel fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he must divide with me <EOS> <SOS>  i am joined with him in the guardianship of missarcy <EOS> <SOS>    are you  indeed <EOS> <SOS>  and pray what sort of guardians do you make <EOS> <SOS>  does your charge give you much trouble <EOS> <SOS>  young ladies of her age  are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the true darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way <EOS> <SOS>   as she spoke  she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed missarcy likely to give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth <EOS> <SOS>  she directly replied   you need not be frightened <EOS> <SOS>  i never heard any harm of her  and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world <EOS> <SOS>  she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance  mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley <EOS> <SOS>  i think i have heard you say that you know them <EOS> <SOS>    i know them a little <EOS> <SOS>  their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man  he is a great friend of darcy s <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  yes   said elizabeth drily   mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him <EOS> <SOS>    care of him <EOS> <SOS>   yes  i really believe darcy  does  take care of him in those points where he most wants care <EOS> <SOS>  from something that he told me in our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him <EOS> <SOS>  but i ought to beg his pardon  for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant <EOS> <SOS>  it was all conjecture <EOS> <SOS>    what is it you mean <EOS> <SOS>    it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known  because if it were to get round to the lady s family  it would be an unpleasant thing <EOS> <SOS>    you may depend upon my not mentioning it <EOS> <SOS>    and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley <EOS> <SOS>  what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any other particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer <EOS> <SOS>    did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference <EOS> <SOS>    i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady <EOS> <SOS>    and what arts did he use to separate them <EOS> <SOS>    he did not talk to me of his own arts   said fitzwilliam smiling <EOS> <SOS>   he only told me  what i have now told you <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with indignation <EOS> <SOS>  after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful <EOS> <SOS>   i am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she <EOS> <SOS>   your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings <EOS> <SOS>  why was he to be the judge <EOS> <SOS>    you are rather disposed to call his interference officious <EOS> <SOS>    i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgment alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy <EOS> <SOS>    but   she continued  recollecting herself   as we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him <EOS> <SOS>  it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case <EOS> <SOS>    that is not an unnatural surmise   said fitzwilliam   but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly <EOS> <SOS>   this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy  that she would not trust herself with an answer  and  therefore  abruptly changing the conversation  talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage <EOS> <SOS>  there  shut into her own room  as soon as their visitor left them  she could think without interruption of all that she had heard <EOS> <SOS>  it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected <EOS> <SOS>  there could not exist in the world  two  men  over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence <EOS> <SOS>  that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane  she had never doubted  but she had always attributed to missingley the principal design and arrangement of them <EOS> <SOS>  if his own vanity  however  did not mislead him   he  was the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered  and still continued to suffer <EOS> <SOS>  he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate  generous heart in the world  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted <EOS> <SOS>   there were some very strong objections against the lady   were colonel fitzwilliam s words  and these strong objections probably were  her having one uncle who was a country attorney  and another who was in business in london <EOS> <SOS>   to jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility of objection <EOS> <SOS>  all loveliness and goodness as she is <EOS> <SOS>  her understanding excellent  her mind improved  and her manners captivating <EOS> <SOS>  neither could any thing be urged against my father  who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will probably never reach <EOS> <SOS>   when she thought of her mother indeed  her confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow that any objections  there  had material weight with mr darcy  whose pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections  than from their want of sense  and she was quite decided at last  that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride  and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister <EOS> <SOS>  the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on a headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening that  added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy  it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to drink tea <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  seeing that she was really unwell  did not press her to go  and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her  but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xi <EOS> <SOS>  when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy  chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent <EOS> <SOS>  they contained no actual complaint  nor was there any revival of past occurrences  or any communication of present suffering <EOS> <SOS>  but in all  and in almost every line of each  there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style  and which  proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself  and kindly disposed towards every one  had been scarcely ever clouded <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness  with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict  gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings <EOS> <SOS>  it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next  and a still greater  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits  by all that affection could do <EOS> <SOS>  she could not think of darcy s leaving kent  without remembering that his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as he was  she did not mean to be unhappy about him <EOS> <SOS>  while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once before called late in the evening  and might now come to enquire particularly after her <EOS> <SOS>  but this idea was soon banished  and her spirits were very differently affected  when  to her utter amazement  she saw mr darcy walk into the room <EOS> <SOS>  in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health  imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better <EOS> <SOS>  she answered him with cold civility <EOS> <SOS>  he sat down for a few moments  and then getting up walked about the room <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was surprised  but said not a word <EOS> <SOS>  after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner  and thus began   in vain have i struggled <EOS> <SOS>  it will not do <EOS> <SOS>  my feelings will not be repressed <EOS> <SOS>  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression <EOS> <SOS>  she stared  coloured  doubted  and was silent <EOS> <SOS>  this he considered sufficient encouragement  and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her  immediately followed <EOS> <SOS>  he spoke well  but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed  and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride <EOS> <SOS>  his sense of her inferiority  of its being a degradation  of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination  were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his suit <EOS> <SOS>  in spite of her deeply rooted dislike  she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection  and though her intentions did not vary for an instant  she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive  till  roused to resentment by his subsequent language  she lost all compassion in anger <EOS> <SOS>  she tried  however  to compose herself to answer him with patience  when he should have done <EOS> <SOS>  he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in spite of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer  and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand <EOS> <SOS>  as he said this  she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer <EOS> <SOS>  he  spoke  of apprehension and anxiety  but his countenance expressed real security <EOS> <SOS>  such a circumstance could only exasperate farther  and when he ceased  the colour rose into her cheeks  and she said   in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however unequally they may be returned <EOS> <SOS>  it is natural that obligation should be felt  and if i could  feel  gratitude  i would now thank you <EOS> <SOS>  but i cannot  i have never desired your good opinion  and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly <EOS> <SOS>  i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one <EOS> <SOS>  it has been most unconsciously done  however  and i hope will be of short duration <EOS> <SOS>  the feelings which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy  who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise <EOS> <SOS>  his complexion became pale with anger  and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature <EOS> <SOS>  he was struggling for the appearance of composure  and would not open his lips  till he believed himself to have attained it <EOS> <SOS>  the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful <EOS> <SOS>  at length  in a voice of forced calmness  he said   and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting <EOS> <SOS>  i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so little  endeavour  at civility  i am thus rejected <EOS> <SOS>  but it is of small importance <EOS> <SOS>    i might as well enquire   replied she   why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will  against your reason  and even against your character <EOS> <SOS>  was not this some excuse for incivility  if i  was  uncivil <EOS> <SOS>  but i have other provocations <EOS> <SOS>  you know i have <EOS> <SOS>  had not my own feelings decided against you  had they been indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man  who has been the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most beloved sister <EOS> <SOS>   as she pronounced these words  mr darcy changed colour  but the emotion was short  and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued <EOS> <SOS>   i have every reason in the world to think ill of you <EOS> <SOS>  no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there  <EOS> <SOS>  you dare not  you cannot deny that you have been the principal  if not the only means of dividing them from each other  of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind <EOS> <SOS>   she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse <EOS> <SOS>  he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity <EOS> <SOS>   can you deny that you have done it <EOS> <SOS>   she repeated <EOS> <SOS>  with assumed tranquillity he then replied   i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister  or that i rejoice in my success <EOS> <SOS>  towards  him  i have been kinder than towards myself <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection  but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to conciliate her <EOS> <SOS>   but it is not merely this affair   she continued   on which my dislike is founded <EOS> <SOS>  long before it had taken place  my opinion of you was decided <EOS> <SOS>  your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham <EOS> <SOS>  on this subject  what can you have to say <EOS> <SOS>  in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself <EOS> <SOS>  or under what misrepresentation  can you here impose upon others <EOS> <SOS>    you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns   said darcy in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour <EOS> <SOS>   who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling an interest in him <EOS> <SOS>    his misfortunes <EOS> <SOS>   repeated darcy contemptuously   yes  his misfortunes have been great indeed <EOS> <SOS>    and of your infliction   cried elizabeth with energy <EOS> <SOS>   you have reduced him to his present state of poverty  comparative poverty <EOS> <SOS>  you have withheld the advantages  which you must know to have been designed for him <EOS> <SOS>  you have deprived the best years of his life  of that independence which was no less his due than his desert <EOS> <SOS>  you have done all this <EOS> <SOS>  and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule <EOS> <SOS>    and this   cried darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the room   is your opinion of me <EOS> <SOS>  this is the estimation in which you hold me <EOS> <SOS>  i thank you for explaining it so fully <EOS> <SOS>  my faults  according to this calculation  are heavy indeed <EOS> <SOS>  but perhaps   added he  stopping in his walk  and turning towards her   these offences might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design <EOS> <SOS>  these bitter accusations might have been suppressed  had i with greater policy concealed my struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by reflection  by every thing <EOS> <SOS>  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence <EOS> <SOS>  nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related <EOS> <SOS>  they were natural and just <EOS> <SOS>  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections <EOS> <SOS>  to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said   you are mistaken  mr darcy  if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you  had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner <EOS> <SOS>   she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she continued   you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it <EOS> <SOS>   again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification <EOS> <SOS>  she went on <EOS> <SOS>   from the very beginning  from the first moment i may almost say  of my acquaintance with you  your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation  on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry <EOS> <SOS>    you have said quite enough  madam <EOS> <SOS>  i perfectly comprehend your feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been <EOS> <SOS>  forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness <EOS> <SOS>   and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house <EOS> <SOS>  the tumult of her mind was now painfully great <EOS> <SOS>  she knew not how to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour <EOS> <SOS>  her astonishment  as she reflected on what had passed  was increased by every review of it <EOS> <SOS>  that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  that he should have been in love with her for so many months <EOS> <SOS>  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister  and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case  was almost incredible <EOS> <SOS>  it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection <EOS> <SOS>  but his pride  his abominable pride  his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane  his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could not justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited <EOS> <SOS>  she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation  and hurried her away to her room <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xii <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes <EOS> <SOS>  she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened  it was impossible to think of any thing else  and totally indisposed for employment  she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise <EOS> <SOS>  she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk  when the recollection of mr darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  she turned up the lane  which led her farther from the turnpike road <EOS> <SOS>  the park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground <EOS> <SOS>  after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she was tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the gates and look into the park <EOS> <SOS>  the five weeks which she had now passed in kent  had made a great difference in the country  and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees <EOS> <SOS>  she was on the point of continuing her walk  when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park  he was moving that way  and fearful of its being mr darcy  she was directly retreating <EOS> <SOS>  but the person who advanced  was now near enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness  pronounced her name <EOS> <SOS>  she had turned away  but on hearing herself called  though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy  she moved again towards the gate <EOS> <SOS>  he had by that time reached it also  and holding out a letter  which she instinctively took  said with a look of haughty composure   i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you <EOS> <SOS>  will you do me the honour of reading that letter <EOS> <SOS>    and then  with a slight bow  turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight <EOS> <SOS>  with no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest curiosity  elizabeth opened the letter  and to her still increasing wonder  perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper  written quite through  in a very close hand <EOS> <SOS>   the envelope itself was likewise full <EOS> <SOS>   pursuing her way along the lane  she then began it <EOS> <SOS>  it was dated from rosings  at eight o clock in the morning  and was as follows          be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments       or renewal of those offers  which were last night so disgusting to      you <EOS> <SOS>  i write without any intention of paining you  or humbling      myself  by dwelling on wishes  which  for the happiness of both       cannot be too soon forgotten  and the effort which the formation       and the perusal of this letter must occasion  should have been      spared  had not my character required it to be written and read <EOS> <SOS>       you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand your      attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but i      demand it of your justice <EOS> <SOS>        two offences of a very different nature  and by no means of equal      magnitude  you last night laid to my charge <EOS> <SOS>  the first mentioned      was  that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i had detached      mr bingley from your sister   and the other  that i had  in      defiance of various claims  in defiance of honour and humanity       ruined the immediate prosperity  and blasted the prospects of mr      wickham <EOS> <SOS>   wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth  the acknowledged favourite of my father  a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage  and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion  would be a depravity       to which the separation of two young persons  whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks  could bear no comparison <EOS> <SOS>   but      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed  respecting each circumstance  i shall hope to be in      future secured  when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read <EOS> <SOS>   if  in the explanation of them which is      due to myself  i am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your s  i can only say that i am sorry <EOS> <SOS>   the      necessity must be obeyed  and farther apology would be absurd <EOS> <SOS>   i      had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common with      others  that bingley preferred your eldest sister  to any other      young woman in the country <EOS> <SOS>   but it was not till the evening of the      dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment <EOS> <SOS>   i had often seen him in love before <EOS> <SOS>   at that      ball  while i had the honour of dancing with you  i was first made      acquainted  by sir william lucas s accidental information  that      bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage <EOS> <SOS>  he spoke of it as a certain event       of which the time alone could be undecided <EOS> <SOS>  from that moment i      observed my friend s behaviour attentively  and i could then      perceive that his partiality for missennet was beyond what i had      ever witnessed in him <EOS> <SOS>  your sister i also watched <EOS> <SOS>   her look and      manners were open  cheerful and engaging as ever  but without any      symptom of peculiar regard  and i remained convinced from the      evening s scrutiny  that though she received his attentions with      pleasure  she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment <EOS> <SOS>   if  you  have not been mistaken here   i  must have      been in an error <EOS> <SOS>  your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable <EOS> <SOS>   if it be so  if i have been misled by such      error  to inflict pain on her  your resentment has not been      unreasonable <EOS> <SOS>  but i shall not scruple to assert  that the serenity      of your sister s countenance and air was such  as might have given      the most acute observer  a conviction that  however amiable her      temper  her heart was not likely to be easily touched <EOS> <SOS>   that i was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain   but i will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears <EOS> <SOS>   i did not believe her to be      indifferent because i wished it   i believed it on impartial      conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason <EOS> <SOS>   my objections to      the marriage were not merely those  which i last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside  in my      own case  the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me <EOS> <SOS>   but there were other causes of      repugnance   causes which  though still existing  and existing to      an equal degree in both instances  i had myself endeavoured to      forget  because they were not immediately before me <EOS> <SOS>   these causes      must be stated  though briefly <EOS> <SOS>   the situation of your mother s      family  though objectionable  was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently  so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself  by your three younger sisters  and occasionally even by      your father <EOS> <SOS>   pardon me <EOS> <SOS>   it pains me to offend you <EOS> <SOS>  but amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations  and your      displeasure at this representation of them  let it give you      consolation to consider that  to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure  is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister  than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both <EOS> <SOS>   i will only say farther  that      from what passed that evening  my opinion of all parties was      confirmed  and every inducement heightened  which could have led me      before  to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy      connection <EOS> <SOS>   he left netherfield for london  on the day following       as you  i am certain  remember  with the design of soon      returning <EOS> <SOS>   the part which i acted  is now to be explained <EOS> <SOS>   his      sisters  uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered  and  alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother  we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in london <EOS> <SOS>   we accordingly      went  and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend  the certain evils of such a choice <EOS> <SOS>   i described  and      enforced them earnestly <EOS> <SOS>   but  however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination  i do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been      seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving  of your      sister s indifference <EOS> <SOS>  he had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere  if not with equal regard <EOS> <SOS>   but bingley has      great natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own <EOS> <SOS>   to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived      himself  was no very difficult point <EOS> <SOS>  to persuade him against      returning into hertfordshire  when that conviction had been given       was scarcely the work of a moment <EOS> <SOS>   i cannot blame myself for      having done thus much <EOS> <SOS>  there is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair  on which i do not reflect with satisfaction  it is      that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister s being in town <EOS> <SOS>  i knew it myself  as      it was known to missingley  but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it <EOS> <SOS>   that they might have met without ill consequence  is      perhaps probable   but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger <EOS> <SOS>   perhaps this      concealment  this disguise  was beneath me <EOS> <SOS>   it is done  however       and it was done for the best <EOS> <SOS>   on this subject i have nothing more      to say  no other apology to offer <EOS> <SOS>  if i have wounded your sister s      feelings  it was unknowingly done  and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient  i have      not yet learnt to condemn them <EOS> <SOS>   with respect to that other  more      weighty accusation  of having injured mr wickham  i can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family <EOS> <SOS>  of what he has  particularly  accused me i am ignorant  but      of the truth of what i shall relate  i can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham is the son of a very      respectable man  who had for many years the management of all the      pemberley estates  and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust  naturally inclined my father to be of service to him  and on      george wickham  who was his god son  his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed <EOS> <SOS>  my father supported him at school  and      afterwards at cambridge   most important assistance  as his own      father  always poor from the extravagance of his wife  would have      been unable to give him a gentleman s education <EOS> <SOS>  my father was not      only fond of this young man s society  whose manners were always      engaging  he had also the highest opinion of him  and hoping the      church would be his profession  intended to provide for him in it <EOS> <SOS>       as for myself  it is many  many years since i first began to think      of him in a very different manner <EOS> <SOS>  the vicious propensities  the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend  could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself  and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments  which mr darcy could not have <EOS> <SOS>       here again i shall give you pain  to what degree you only can tell <EOS> <SOS>       but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created  a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character <EOS> <SOS>  it adds even another motive <EOS> <SOS>  my excellent father      died about five years ago  and his attachment to mr wickham was to      the last so steady  that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me  to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow  and if he took orders  desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant <EOS> <SOS>  there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>  his own      father did not long survive mine  and within half a year from these      events  mr wickham wrote to inform me that  having finally      resolved against taking orders  he hoped i should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage  in lieu of the preferment  by which he could not be      benefited <EOS> <SOS>  he had some intention  he added  of studying the law       and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein <EOS> <SOS>  i rather wished  than      believed him to be sincere  but at any rate  was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal <EOS> <SOS>  i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a      clergyman <EOS> <SOS>  the business was therefore soon settled <EOS> <SOS>  he resigned all      claim to assistance in the church  were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it  and accepted in return three      thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>  all connection between us seemed now dissolved <EOS> <SOS>  i      thought too ill of him  to invite him to pemberley  or admit his      society in town <EOS> <SOS>  in town i believe he chiefly lived  but his      studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free from all      restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation <EOS> <SOS>  for      about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation <EOS> <SOS>  his circumstances  he      assured me  and i had no difficulty in believing it  were      exceedingly bad <EOS> <SOS>  he had found the law a most unprofitable study       and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained  if i would      present him to the living in question  of which he trusted there      could be little doubt  as he was well assured that i had no other      person to provide for  and i could not have forgotten my revered      father s intentions <EOS> <SOS>  you will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty  or for resisting every repetition of it <EOS> <SOS>       his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances  and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others  as in his reproaches to myself <EOS> <SOS>  after this period  every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt <EOS> <SOS>  how he lived i know not <EOS> <SOS>  but      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice <EOS> <SOS>  i      must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget      myself  and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being <EOS> <SOS>  having said thus much  i feel no      doubt of your secrecy <EOS> <SOS>  my sister  who is more than ten years my      junior  was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew  colonel      fitzwilliam  and myself <EOS> <SOS>  about a year ago  she was taken from      school  and an establishment formed for her in london  and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it  to ramsgate       and thither also went mr wickham  undoubtedly by design  for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mr <EOS> <SOS>       younge  in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  and by      her connivance and aid  he so far recommended himself to georgiana       whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child  that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love  and to consent to an elopement <EOS> <SOS>  she was then but      fifteen  which must be her excuse  and after stating her      imprudence  i am happy to add  that i owed the knowledge of it to      herself <EOS> <SOS>  i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement  and then georgiana  unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father  acknowledged the whole to me <EOS> <SOS>  you may imagine what i felt      and how i acted <EOS> <SOS>  regard for my sister s credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure  but i wrote to mr wickham  who left      the place immediately  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  younge was of course removed from      her charge <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham s chief object was unquestionably my      sister s fortune  which is thirty thousand pounds  but i cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me  was a      strong inducement <EOS> <SOS>  his revenge would have been complete indeed <EOS> <SOS>       this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards mr wickham <EOS> <SOS>  i know not in what manner  under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you  but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at <EOS> <SOS>  ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either  detection could not be in your power  and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination <EOS> <SOS>  you may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night <EOS> <SOS>  but i was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed <EOS> <SOS>       for the truth of every thing here related  i can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam  who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy  and still more as one of      the executors of my father s will  has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions <EOS> <SOS>  if your abhorrence of       me  should make  my  assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin  and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him  i shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning <EOS> <SOS>  i will only add  god bless you <EOS> <SOS>        fitzwilliam darcy <EOS> <SOS>   chapter xiii <EOS> <SOS>  if elizabeth  when mr darcy gave her the letter  did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no expectation at all of its contents <EOS> <SOS>  but such as they were  it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them  and what a contrariety of emotion they excited <EOS> <SOS>  her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined <EOS> <SOS>  with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal <EOS> <SOS>  with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say  she began his account of what had happened at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>  she read  with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension  and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring  was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes <EOS> <SOS>  his belief of her sister s insensibility  she instantly resolved to be false  and his account of the real  the worst objections to the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice <EOS> <SOS>  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her  his style was not penitent  but haughty <EOS> <SOS>  it was all pride and insolence <EOS> <SOS>  but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham  when she read with somewhat clearer attention  a relation of events  which  if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself  her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition <EOS> <SOS>  astonishment  apprehension  and even horror  oppressed her <EOS> <SOS>  she wished to discredit it entirely  repeatedly exclaiming   this must be false <EOS> <SOS>  this cannot be <EOS> <SOS>  this must be the grossest falsehood <EOS> <SOS>    and when she had gone through the whole letter  though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not regard it  that she would never look in it again <EOS> <SOS>  in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the letter was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she could  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham  and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence <EOS> <SOS>  the account of his connection with the pemberley family  was exactly what he had related himself  and the kindness of the late mr darcy  though she had not before known its extent  agreed equally well with his own words <EOS> <SOS>  so far each recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the will  the difference was great <EOS> <SOS>  what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that her wishes did not err <EOS> <SOS>  but when she read  and re read with the closest attention  the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living  of his receiving in lieu  so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds  again was she forced to hesitate <EOS> <SOS>  she put down the letter  weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality  deliberated on the probability of each statement  but with little success <EOS> <SOS>  on both sides it was only assertion <EOS> <SOS>  again she read on <EOS> <SOS>  but every line proved more clearly that the affair  which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent  as to render mr darcy s conduct in it less than infamous  was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole <EOS> <SOS>  the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more so  as she could bring no proof of its injustice <EOS> <SOS>  she had never heard of him before his entrance into the     shire militia  in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man  who  on meeting him accidentally in town  had there renewed a slight acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  of his former way of life  nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself <EOS> <SOS>  as to his real character  had information been in her power  she had never felt a wish of enquiring <EOS> <SOS>  his countenance  voice  and manner  had established him at once in the possession of every virtue <EOS> <SOS>  she tried to recollect some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for those casual errors  under which she would endeavour to class  what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance <EOS> <SOS>  but no such recollection befriended her <EOS> <SOS>  she could see him instantly before her  in every charm of air and address  but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood  and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess <EOS> <SOS>  after pausing on this point a considerable while  she once more continued to read <EOS> <SOS>  but  alas <EOS> <SOS>  the story which followed of his designs on missarcy  received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself  from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs  and whose character she had no reason to question <EOS> <SOS>  at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him  but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application  and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration <EOS> <SOS>  she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself  in their first evening at mr philips s <EOS> <SOS>  many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory <EOS> <SOS>  she was  now  struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger  and wondered it had escaped her before <EOS> <SOS>  she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done  and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct <EOS> <SOS>  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy  that mr darcy might leave the country  but that  he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week <EOS> <SOS>  she remembered also  that till the netherfield family had quitted the country  he had told his story to no one but herself  but that after their removal  it had been every where discussed  that he had then no reserves  no scruples in sinking mr darcy s character  though he had assured her that respect for the father  would always prevent his exposing the son <EOS> <SOS>  how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned <EOS> <SOS>  his attentions to missing were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes  but his eagerness to grasp at any thing <EOS> <SOS>  his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive  he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn <EOS> <SOS>  every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter  and in farther justification of mr darcy  she could not but allow that mr bingley  when questioned by jane  had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair  that proud and repulsive as were his manners  she had never  in the whole course of their acquaintance  an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together  and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways  seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust  any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits <EOS> <SOS>  that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued  that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother  and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of  some  amiable feeling <EOS> <SOS>  that had his actions been what wickham represented them  so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world  and that friendship between a person capable of it  and such an amiable man as mr bingley  was incomprehensible <EOS> <SOS>  she grew absolutely ashamed of herself <EOS> <SOS>   of neither darcy nor wickham could she think  without feeling that she had been blind  partial  prejudiced  absurd <EOS> <SOS>   how despicably have i acted <EOS> <SOS>   she cried <EOS> <SOS>    i  who have prided myself on my discernment <EOS> <SOS>   i  who have valued myself on my abilities <EOS> <SOS>  who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister  and gratified my vanity  in useless or blameable distrust <EOS> <SOS>   how humiliating is this discovery <EOS> <SOS>   yet  how just a humiliation <EOS> <SOS>   had i been in love  i could not have been more wretchedly blind <EOS> <SOS>  but vanity  not love  has been my folly <EOS> <SOS>   pleased with the preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either were concerned <EOS> <SOS>  till this moment  i never knew myself <EOS> <SOS>   from herself to jane  from jane to bingley  her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy s explanation  there   had appeared very insufficient  and she read it again <EOS> <SOS>  widely different was the effect of a second perusal <EOS> <SOS>   how could she deny that credit to his assertions  in one instance  which she had been obliged to give in the other <EOS> <SOS>   he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment   and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been <EOS> <SOS>   neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane <EOS> <SOS>   she felt that jane s feelings  though fervent  were little displayed  and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner  not often united with great sensibility <EOS> <SOS>  when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned  in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her sense of shame was severe <EOS> <SOS>  the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial  and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded  as having passed at the netherfield ball  and as confirming all his first disapprobation  could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers <EOS> <SOS>  the compliment to herself and her sister  was not unfelt <EOS> <SOS>  it soothed  but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family   and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations  and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct  she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before <EOS> <SOS>  after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every variety of thought  re considering events  determining probabilities  and reconciling herself as well as she could  to a change so sudden and so important  fatigue  and a recollection of her long absence  made her at length return home  and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual  and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation <EOS> <SOS>  she was immediately told  that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence  mr darcy  only for a few minutes to take leave  but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour  hoping for her return  and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in missing him  she really rejoiced at it <EOS> <SOS>  colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object <EOS> <SOS>  she could think only of her letter <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xiv <EOS> <SOS>  the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting obeisance  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of their appearing in very good health  and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected  after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings <EOS> <SOS>  to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine  and her daughter  and on his return  brought back  with great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship  importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting  that had she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to her  as her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of what her ladyship s indignation would have been <EOS> <SOS>   what would she have said <EOS> <SOS>   how would she have behaved <EOS> <SOS>   were questions with which she amused herself <EOS> <SOS>  their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party <EOS> <SOS>    i assure you  i feel it exceedingly   said lady catherine   i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do <EOS> <SOS>  but i am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be so much attached to me <EOS> <SOS>   they were excessively sorry to go <EOS> <SOS>  but so they always are <EOS> <SOS>  the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last  but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely  more i think than last year <EOS> <SOS>  his attachment to rosings  certainly increases <EOS> <SOS>   mr collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here  which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine observed  after dinner  that missennet seemed out of spirits  and immediately accounting for it herself  by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon  she added   but if that is the case  you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins will be very glad of your company  i am sure <EOS> <SOS>    i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation   replied elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it <EOS> <SOS>   i must be in town next saturday <EOS> <SOS>    why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks <EOS> <SOS>  i expected you to stay two months <EOS> <SOS>  i told mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins so before you came <EOS> <SOS>  there can be no occasion for your going so soon <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight <EOS> <SOS>    but my father cannot <EOS> <SOS>   he wrote last week to hurry my return <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can <EOS> <SOS>   daughters are never of so much consequence to a father <EOS> <SOS>  and if you will stay another  month  complete  it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london  for i am going there early in june  for a week  and as dawson does not object to the barouche box  there will be very good room for one of you  and indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i should not object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large <EOS> <SOS>    you are all kindness  madam  but i believe we must abide by our original plan <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine seemed resigned <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  you must send a servant with them <EOS> <SOS>  you know i always speak my mind  and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves <EOS> <SOS>  it is highly improper <EOS> <SOS>  you must contrive to send somebody <EOS> <SOS>  i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing <EOS> <SOS>   young women should always be properly guarded and attended  according to their situation in life <EOS> <SOS>  when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer  i made a point of her having two men servants go with her <EOS> <SOS>   missarcy  the daughter of mr darcy  of pemberley  and lady anne  could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner <EOS> <SOS>   i am excessively attentive to all those things <EOS> <SOS>  you must send john with the young ladies  mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins <EOS> <SOS>  i am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would really be discreditable to  you  to let them go alone <EOS> <SOS>    my uncle is to send a servant for us <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>   your uncle <EOS> <SOS>   he keeps a man servant  does he <EOS> <SOS>   i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things <EOS> <SOS>  where shall you change horses <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  bromley  of course <EOS> <SOS>   if you mention my name at the bell  you will be attended to <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey  and as she did not answer them all herself  attention was necessary  which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or  with a mind so occupied  she might have forgotten where she was <EOS> <SOS>  reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was alone  she gave way to it as the greatest relief  and not a day went by without a solitary walk  in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy s letter  she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart <EOS> <SOS>  she studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different <EOS> <SOS>  when she remembered the style of his address  she was still full of indignation  but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him  her anger was turned against herself  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion <EOS> <SOS>  his attachment excited gratitude  his general character respect  but she could not approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again <EOS> <SOS>  in her own past behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and regret  and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin <EOS> <SOS>  they were hopeless of remedy <EOS> <SOS>  her father  contented with laughing at them  would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters  and her mother  with manners so far from right herself  was entirely insensible of the evil <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia  but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence  what chance could there be of improvement <EOS> <SOS>  catherine  weak spirited  irritable  and completely under lydia s guidance  had been always affronted by their advice  and lydia  self willed and careless  would scarcely give them a hearing <EOS> <SOS>  they were ignorant  idle  and vain <EOS> <SOS>  while there was an officer in meryton  they would flirt with him  and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn  they would be going there for ever <EOS> <SOS>  anxiety on jane s behalf  was another prevailing concern  and mr darcy s explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion  heightened the sense of what jane had lost <EOS> <SOS>  his affection was proved to have been sincere  and his conduct cleared of all blame  unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend <EOS> <SOS>  how grievous then was the thought that  of a situation so desirable in every respect  so replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had been deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family <EOS> <SOS>  when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character  it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before  were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful <EOS> <SOS>  their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay  as they had been at first <EOS> <SOS>  the very last evening was spent there  and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey  gave them directions as to the best method of packing  and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way  that maria thought herself obliged  on her return  to undo all the work of the morning  and pack her trunk afresh <EOS> <SOS>  when they parted  lady catherine  with great condescension  wished them a good journey  and invited them to come to hunsford again next year  and misse bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xv <EOS> <SOS>  on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared  and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary <EOS> <SOS>   i know not  misslizabeth   said he   whether mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it <EOS> <SOS>  the favour of your company has been much felt  i assure you <EOS> <SOS>  we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode <EOS> <SOS>  our plain manner of living  our small rooms  and few domestics  and the little we see of the world  must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension  and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness <EOS> <SOS>  she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of being with charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received  must make  her  feel the obliged <EOS> <SOS>  mr collins was gratified  and with a more smiling solemnity replied   it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably <EOS> <SOS>  we have certainly done our best  and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society  and from our connection with rosings  the frequent means of varying the humble home scene  i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome <EOS> <SOS>  our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast <EOS> <SOS>  you see on what a footing we are <EOS> <SOS>  you see how continually we are engaged there <EOS> <SOS>  in truth i must acknowledge that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion  while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings <EOS> <SOS>   words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he was obliged to walk about the room  while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences <EOS> <SOS>   you may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire  my dear cousin <EOS> <SOS>  i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine s great attentions to mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins you have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate  but on this point it will be as well to be silent <EOS> <SOS>  only let me assure you  my dear misslizabeth  that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage <EOS> <SOS>  my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking <EOS> <SOS>  there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us <EOS> <SOS>  we seem to have been designed for each other <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case  and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts <EOS> <SOS>  she was not sorry  however  to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung <EOS> <SOS>  poor charlotte <EOS> <SOS>   it was melancholy to leave her to such society <EOS> <SOS>   but she had chosen it with her eyes open  and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go  she did not seem to ask for compassion <EOS> <SOS>  her home and her housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their dependent concerns  had not yet lost their charms <EOS> <SOS>  at length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the parcels placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready <EOS> <SOS>  after an affectionate parting between the friends  elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins  and as they walked down the garden  he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family  not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter  and his compliments to mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  though unknown <EOS> <SOS>  he then handed her in  maria followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  when he suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings <EOS> <SOS>   but   he added   you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth made no objection   the door was then allowed to be shut  and the carriage drove off <EOS> <SOS>   good gracious <EOS> <SOS>   cried maria  after a few minutes silence   it seems but a day or two since we first came <EOS> <SOS>   and yet how many things have happened <EOS> <SOS>    a great many indeed   said her companion with a sigh <EOS> <SOS>   we have dined nine times at rosings  besides drinking tea there twice <EOS> <SOS>   how much i shall have to tell <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth privately added   and how much i shall have to conceal <EOS> <SOS>   their journey was performed without much conversation  or any alarm  and within four hours of their leaving hunsford  they reached mr gardiner s house  where they were to remain a few days <EOS> <SOS>  jane looked well  and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits  amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them <EOS> <SOS>  but jane was to go home with her  and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation <EOS> <SOS>  it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn  before she told her sister of mr darcy s proposals <EOS> <SOS>  to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane  and must  at the same time  so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away  was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered  but the state of indecision in which she remained  as to the extent of what she should communicate  and her fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried into repeating something of bingley  which might only grieve her sister farther <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xvi <EOS> <SOS>  it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street  for the town of      in hertfordshire  and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet s carriage was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in token of the coachman s punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs <EOS> <SOS>  these two girls had been above an hour in the place  happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and dressing a sallad and cucumber <EOS> <SOS>  after welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords  exclaiming   is not this nice <EOS> <SOS>  is not this an agreeable surprise <EOS> <SOS>    and we mean to treat you all   added lydia   but you must lend us the money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there <EOS> <SOS>   then shewing her purchases   look here  i have bought this bonnet <EOS> <SOS>  i do not think it is very pretty  but i thought i might as well buy it as not <EOS> <SOS>  i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home  and see if i can make it up any better <EOS> <SOS>   and when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect unconcern   oh <EOS> <SOS>  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop  and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh  i think it will be very tolerable <EOS> <SOS>  besides  it will not much signify what one wears this summer  after the     shire have left meryton  and they are going in a fortnight <EOS> <SOS>    are they indeed <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth  with the greatest satisfaction <EOS> <SOS>   they are going to be encamped near brighton  and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer <EOS> <SOS>  it would be such a delicious scheme  and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all <EOS> <SOS>  mamma would like to go too of all things <EOS> <SOS>  only think what a miserable summer else we shall have <EOS> <SOS>    yes   thought elizabeth    that  would be a delightful scheme  indeed  and completely do for us at once <EOS> <SOS>  good heaven <EOS> <SOS>  brighton  and a whole campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of meryton <EOS> <SOS>    now i have got some news for you   said lydia  as they sat down to table <EOS> <SOS>   what do you think <EOS> <SOS>  it is excellent news  capital news  and about a certain person that we all like <EOS> <SOS>   jane and elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told that he need not stay <EOS> <SOS>  lydia laughed  and said   aye  that is just like your formality and discretion <EOS> <SOS>  you thought the waiter must not hear  as if he cared <EOS> <SOS>  i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say <EOS> <SOS>  but he is an ugly fellow <EOS> <SOS>  i am glad he is gone <EOS> <SOS>  i never saw such a long chin in my life <EOS> <SOS>  well  but now for my news  it is about dear wickham  too good for the waiter  is not it <EOS> <SOS>  there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king <EOS> <SOS>  there s for you <EOS> <SOS>  she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool  gone to stay <EOS> <SOS>  wickham is safe <EOS> <SOS>    and mary king is safe <EOS> <SOS>   added elizabeth   safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune <EOS> <SOS>    she is a great fool for going away  if she liked him <EOS> <SOS>    but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side   said jane <EOS> <SOS>   i am sure there is not on  his  <EOS> <SOS>  i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her <EOS> <SOS>  who  could  about such a nasty little freckled thing <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such coarseness of  expression  herself  the coarseness of the  sentiment  was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all their boxes  workbags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases  were seated in it <EOS> <SOS>   how nicely we are crammed in <EOS> <SOS>   cried lydia <EOS> <SOS>   i am glad i bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox <EOS> <SOS>  well  now let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk and laugh all the way home <EOS> <SOS>  and in the first place  let us hear what has happened to you all  since you went away <EOS> <SOS>  have you seen any pleasant men <EOS> <SOS>  have you had any flirting <EOS> <SOS>  i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back <EOS> <SOS>  jane will be quite an old maid soon  i declare <EOS> <SOS>  she is almost three and twenty <EOS> <SOS>  lord  how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty <EOS> <SOS>  my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands  you can t think <EOS> <SOS>  she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins  but  i  do not think there would have been any fun in it <EOS> <SOS>  lord <EOS> <SOS>  how i should like to be married before any of you  and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls <EOS> <SOS>  dear me <EOS> <SOS>  we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s <EOS> <SOS>  kitty and me were to spend the day there  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster promised to have a little dance in the evening   by the bye  mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster and me are  such  friends <EOS> <SOS>   and so she asked the two harringtons to come  but harriet was ill  and so pen was forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did <EOS> <SOS>  we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes  on purpose to pass for a lady   only think what fun <EOS> <SOS>  not a soul knew of it  but col <EOS> <SOS>  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster  and kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how well he looked <EOS> <SOS>  when denny  and wickham  and pratt  and two or three more of the men came in  they did not know him in the least <EOS> <SOS>  lord <EOS> <SOS>  how i laughed <EOS> <SOS>  and so did mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster <EOS> <SOS>  i thought i should have died <EOS> <SOS>  and  that  made the men suspect something  and then they soon found out what was the matter <EOS> <SOS>   with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes  did lydia  assisted by kitty s hints and additions  endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth listened as little as she could  but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name <EOS> <SOS>  their reception at home was most kind <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth   i am glad you are come back  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>   their party in the dining room was large  for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were the subjects which occupied them  lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was doubly engaged  on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane  who sat some way below her  and on the other  retailing them all to the younger missucases  and lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person s  was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  mary   said she   i wish you had gone with us  for we had such fun <EOS> <SOS>  as we went along  kitty and me drew up all the blinds  and pretended there was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone so all the way  if kitty had not been sick  and when we got to the george  i do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and if you would have gone  we would have treated you too <EOS> <SOS>  and then when we came away it was such fun <EOS> <SOS>  i thought we never should have got into the coach <EOS> <SOS>  i was ready to die of laughter <EOS> <SOS>  and then we were so merry all the way home <EOS> <SOS>  we talked and laughed so loud  that any body might have heard us ten miles off <EOS> <SOS>   to this  mary very gravely replied   far be it from me  my dear sister  to depreciate such pleasures <EOS> <SOS>  they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds <EOS> <SOS>  but i confess they would have no charms for  me  <EOS> <SOS>  i should infinitely prefer a book <EOS> <SOS>   but of this answer lydia heard not a word <EOS> <SOS>  she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute  and never attended to mary at all <EOS> <SOS>  in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on  but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme <EOS> <SOS>  it should not be said  that the missennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers <EOS> <SOS>  there was another reason too for her opposition <EOS> <SOS>  she dreaded seeing wickham again  and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible <EOS> <SOS>  the comfort to  her   of the regiment s approaching removal  was indeed beyond expression <EOS> <SOS>  in a fortnight they were to go  and once gone  she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account <EOS> <SOS>  she had not been many hours at home  before she found that the brighton scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn  was under frequent discussion between her parents <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding  but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal  that her mother  though often disheartened  had never yet despaired of succeeding at last <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xvii <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome  and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing her to be surprised  she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself <EOS> <SOS>  missennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings <EOS> <SOS>  she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him <EOS> <SOS>   his being so sure of succeeding  was wrong   said she   and certainly ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it must increase his disappointment <EOS> <SOS>    indeed   replied elizabeth   i am heartily sorry for him  but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me <EOS> <SOS>  you do not blame me  however  for refusing him <EOS> <SOS>    blame you <EOS> <SOS>  oh  no <EOS> <SOS>    but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham <EOS> <SOS>    no  i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did <EOS> <SOS>    but you  will  know it  when i have told you what happened the very next day <EOS> <SOS>   she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham <EOS> <SOS>  what a stroke was this for poor jane <EOS> <SOS>  who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind  as was here collected in one individual <EOS> <SOS>  nor was darcy s vindication  though grateful to her feelings  capable of consoling her for such discovery <EOS> <SOS>  most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error  and seek to clear one  without involving the other <EOS> <SOS>   this will not do   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing <EOS> <SOS>  take your choice  but you must be satisfied with only one <EOS> <SOS>  there is but such a quantity of merit between them  just enough to make one good sort of man  and of late it has been shifting about pretty much <EOS> <SOS>  for my part  i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s  but you shall do as you chuse <EOS> <SOS>   it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from jane <EOS> <SOS>   i do not know when i have been more shocked   said she <EOS> <SOS>   wickham so very bad <EOS> <SOS>  it is almost past belief <EOS> <SOS>  and poor mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  dear lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered <EOS> <SOS>  such a disappointment <EOS> <SOS>  and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too <EOS> <SOS>  and having to relate such a thing of his sister <EOS> <SOS>  it is really too distressing <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure you must feel it so <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both <EOS> <SOS>  i know you will do him such ample justice  that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent <EOS> <SOS>  your profusion makes me saving  and if you lament over him much longer  my heart will be as light as a feather <EOS> <SOS>    poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance <EOS> <SOS>  such an openness and gentleness in his manner <EOS> <SOS>    there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men <EOS> <SOS>  one has got all the goodness  and the other all the appearance of it <EOS> <SOS>    i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it as you used to do <EOS> <SOS>    and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him  without any reason <EOS> <SOS>  it is such a spur to one s genius  such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind <EOS> <SOS>  one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just  but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty <EOS> <SOS>    lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now <EOS> <SOS>    indeed i could not <EOS> <SOS>  i was uncomfortable enough <EOS> <SOS>  i was very uncomfortable  i may say unhappy <EOS> <SOS>  and with no one to speak to  of what i felt  no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  how i wanted you <EOS> <SOS>    how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy  for now they  do  appear wholly undeserved <EOS> <SOS>    certainly <EOS> <SOS>  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness  is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging <EOS> <SOS>  there is one point  on which i want your advice <EOS> <SOS>  i want to be told whether i ought  or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character <EOS> <SOS>   missennet paused a little and then replied   surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully <EOS> <SOS>  what is your own opinion <EOS> <SOS>    that it ought not to be attempted <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public <EOS> <SOS>  on the contrary every particular relative to his sister  was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct  who will believe me <EOS> <SOS>  the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent  that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton  to attempt to place him in an amiable light <EOS> <SOS>  i am not equal to it <EOS> <SOS>  wickham will soon be gone  and therefore it will not signify to anybody here  what he really is <EOS> <SOS>  sometime hence it will be all found out  and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before <EOS> <SOS>  at present i will say nothing about it <EOS> <SOS>    you are quite right <EOS> <SOS>  to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever <EOS> <SOS>  he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done  and anxious to re establish a character <EOS> <SOS>  we must not make him desperate <EOS> <SOS>   the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation <EOS> <SOS>  she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight  and was certain of a willing listener in jane  whenever she might wish to talk again of either <EOS> <SOS>  but there was still something lurking behind  of which prudence forbad the disclosure <EOS> <SOS>  she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy s letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend <EOS> <SOS>  here was knowledge in which no one could partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery <EOS> <SOS>   and then   said she   if that very improbable event should ever take place  i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself <EOS> <SOS>  the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value <EOS> <SOS>   she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits <EOS> <SOS>  jane was not happy <EOS> <SOS>  she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley <EOS> <SOS>  having never even fancied herself in love before  her regard had all the warmth of first attachment  and from her age and disposition  greater steadiness than first attachments often boast  and so fervently did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every other man  that all her good sense  and all her attention to the feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets  which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity <EOS> <SOS>   well  lizzy   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet one day   what is your opinion  now  of this sad business of jane s <EOS> <SOS>  for my part  i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody <EOS> <SOS>  i told my sister philips so the other day <EOS> <SOS>  but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london <EOS> <SOS>  well  he is a very undeserving young man  and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now <EOS> <SOS>  there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer  and i have enquired of every body too  who is likely to know <EOS> <SOS>    i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more <EOS> <SOS>    oh  well <EOS> <SOS>  it is just as he chooses <EOS> <SOS>  nobody wants him to come <EOS> <SOS>  though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill  and if i was her  i would not have put up with it <EOS> <SOS>  well  my comfort is  i am sure jane will die of a broken heart  and then he will be sorry for what he has done <EOS> <SOS>   but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation  she made no answer <EOS> <SOS>   well  lizzy   continued her mother soon afterwards   and so the collinses live very comfortable  do they <EOS> <SOS>  well  well  i only hope it will last <EOS> <SOS>  and what sort of table do they keep <EOS> <SOS>  charlotte is an excellent manager  i dare say <EOS> <SOS>  if she is half as sharp as her mother  she is saving enough <EOS> <SOS>  there is nothing extravagant in  their  housekeeping  i dare say <EOS> <SOS>    no  nothing at all <EOS> <SOS>    a great deal of good management  depend upon it <EOS> <SOS>  yes  yes <EOS> <SOS>   they  will take care not to outrun their income <EOS> <SOS>   they  will never be distressed for money <EOS> <SOS>  well  much good may it do them <EOS> <SOS>  and so  i suppose  they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead <EOS> <SOS>  they look upon it quite as their own  i dare say  whenever that happens <EOS> <SOS>    it was a subject which they could not mention before me <EOS> <SOS>    no <EOS> <SOS>  it would have been strange if they had <EOS> <SOS>  but i make no doubt  they often talk of it between themselves <EOS> <SOS>  well  if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the better <EOS> <SOS>   i  should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me <EOS> <SOS>   chapter xviii <EOS> <SOS>  the first week of their return was soon gone <EOS> <SOS>  the second began <EOS> <SOS>  it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton  and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace <EOS> <SOS>  the dejection was almost universal <EOS> <SOS>  the elder missennets alone were still able to eat  drink  and sleep  and pursue the usual course of their employments <EOS> <SOS>  very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia  whose own misery was extreme  and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family <EOS> <SOS>   good heaven <EOS> <SOS>  what is to become of us <EOS> <SOS>  what are we to do <EOS> <SOS>   would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe <EOS> <SOS>   how can you be smiling so  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>   their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion  five and twenty years ago <EOS> <SOS>   i am sure   said she   i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away <EOS> <SOS>  i thought i should have broke my heart <EOS> <SOS>    i am sure i shall break  mine    said lydia <EOS> <SOS>   if one could but go to brighton <EOS> <SOS>   observed mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>   oh  yes <EOS> <SOS>   if one could but go to brighton <EOS> <SOS>  but papa is so disagreeable <EOS> <SOS>    a little sea bathing would set me up for ever <EOS> <SOS>    and my aunt philips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of good   added kitty <EOS> <SOS>  such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame <EOS> <SOS>  she felt anew the justice of mr darcy s objections  and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend <EOS> <SOS>  but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away  for she received an invitation from mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster  the wife of the colonel of the regiment  to accompany her to brighton <EOS> <SOS>  this invaluable friend was a very young woman  and very lately married <EOS> <SOS>  a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of their  three  months  acquaintance they had been intimate  two  <EOS> <SOS>  the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster  the delight of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  and the mortification of kitty  are scarcely to be described <EOS> <SOS>  wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings  lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy  calling for every one s congratulations  and laughing and talking with more violence than ever  whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish <EOS> <SOS>   i cannot see why mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster should not ask  me  as well as lydia   said she   though i am  not  her particular friend <EOS> <SOS>  i have just as much right to be asked as she has  and more too  for i am two years older <EOS> <SOS>   in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to make her resigned <EOS> <SOS>  as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia  that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter  and detestable as such a step must make her were it known  she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go <EOS> <SOS>  she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour  the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster  and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton  where the temptations must be greater than at home <EOS> <SOS>  he heard her attentively  and then said   lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances <EOS> <SOS>    if you were aware   said elizabeth   of the very great disadvantage to us all  which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner  nay  which has already arisen from it  i am sure you would judge differently in the affair <EOS> <SOS>    already arisen <EOS> <SOS>   repeated mr bennet <EOS> <SOS>   what  has she frightened away some of your lovers <EOS> <SOS>  poor little lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  but do not be cast down <EOS> <SOS>  such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity  are not worth a regret <EOS> <SOS>  come  let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly <EOS> <SOS>    indeed you are mistaken <EOS> <SOS>  i have no such injuries to resent <EOS> <SOS>  it is not of peculiar  but of general evils  which i am now complaining <EOS> <SOS>  our importance  our respectability in the world  must be affected by the wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character <EOS> <SOS>  excuse me  for i must speak plainly <EOS> <SOS>  if you  my dear father  will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits  and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life  she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment <EOS> <SOS>  her character will be fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous <EOS> <SOS>  a flirt too  in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person  and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind  wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite <EOS> <SOS>  in this danger kitty is also comprehended <EOS> <SOS>  she will follow wherever lydia leads <EOS> <SOS>  vain  ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrouled <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear father  can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known  and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and affectionately taking her hand  said in reply   do not make yourself uneasy  my love <EOS> <SOS>  wherever you and jane are known  you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of  or i may say  three very silly sisters <EOS> <SOS>  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton <EOS> <SOS>  let her go then <EOS> <SOS>  colonel forster is a sensible man  and will keep her out of any real mischief  and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body <EOS> <SOS>  at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here <EOS> <SOS>  the officers will find women better worth their notice <EOS> <SOS>  let us hope  therefore  that her being there may teach her her own insignificance <EOS> <SOS>  at any rate  she cannot grow many degrees worse  without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life <EOS> <SOS>   with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own opinion continued the same  and she left him disappointed and sorry <EOS> <SOS>  it was not in her nature  however  to increase her vexations  by dwelling on them <EOS> <SOS>  she was confident of having performed her duty  and to fret over unavoidable evils  or augment them by anxiety  was no part of her disposition <EOS> <SOS>  had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father  their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility <EOS> <SOS>  in lydia s imagination  a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness <EOS> <SOS>  she saw with the creative eye of fancy  the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers <EOS> <SOS>  she saw herself the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them at present unknown <EOS> <SOS>  she saw all the glories of the camp  its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and to complete the view  she saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once <EOS> <SOS>  had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these  what would have been her sensations <EOS> <SOS>  they could have been understood only by her mother  who might have felt nearly the same <EOS> <SOS>  lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself <EOS> <SOS>  but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time <EOS> <SOS>  having been frequently in company with him since her return  agitation was pretty well over  the agitations of former partiality entirely so <EOS> <SOS>  she had even learnt to detect  in the very gentleness which had first delighted her  an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary <EOS> <SOS>  in his present behaviour to herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance  could only serve  after what had since passed  to provoke her <EOS> <SOS>  she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry  and while she steadily repressed it  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing  that however long  and for whatever cause  his attentions had been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal <EOS> <SOS>  on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton  he dined with others of the officers at longbourn  and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour  that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford  she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings  and asked him if he were acquainted with the former <EOS> <SOS>  he looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly seen him often  and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man  asked her how she had liked him <EOS> <SOS>  her answer was warmly in his favour <EOS> <SOS>  with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added   how long did you say that he was at rosings <EOS> <SOS>    nearly three weeks <EOS> <SOS>    and you saw him frequently <EOS> <SOS>    yes  almost every day <EOS> <SOS>    his manners are very different from his cousin s <EOS> <SOS>    yes  very different <EOS> <SOS>  but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>    indeed <EOS> <SOS>   cried wickham with a look which did not escape her <EOS> <SOS>   and pray may i ask <EOS> <SOS>   but checking himself  he added in a gayer tone   is it in address that he improves <EOS> <SOS>  has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style <EOS> <SOS>  for i dare not hope   he continued in a lower and more serious tone   that he is improved in essentials <EOS> <SOS>    oh  no <EOS> <SOS>   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   in essentials  i believe  he is very much what he ever was <EOS> <SOS>   while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning <EOS> <SOS>  there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention  while she added   when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement  but that from knowing him better  his disposition was better understood <EOS> <SOS>   wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off his embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the gentlest of accents   you  who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy  will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the  appearance  of what is right <EOS> <SOS>  his pride  in that direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by <EOS> <SOS>  i only fear that the sort of cautiousness  to which you  i imagine  have been alluding  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt  of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe <EOS> <SOS>  his fear of her  has always operated  i know  when they were together  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with misse bourgh  which i am certain he has very much at heart <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head <EOS> <SOS>  she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances  and she was in no humour to indulge him <EOS> <SOS>  the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance   on his side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth  and they parted at last with mutual civility  and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again <EOS> <SOS>  when the party broke up  lydia returned with mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster to meryton  from whence they were to set out early the next morning <EOS> <SOS>  the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic <EOS> <SOS>  kitty was the only one who shed tears  but she did weep from vexation and envy <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter  and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible  advice  which there was every reason to believe would be attended to  and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xix <EOS> <SOS>  had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort <EOS> <SOS>  her father captivated by youth and beauty  and that appearance of good humour  which youth and beauty generally give  had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind  had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her <EOS> <SOS>  respect  esteem  and confidence  had vanished for ever  and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown <EOS> <SOS>  but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice <EOS> <SOS>  he was fond of the country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments <EOS> <SOS>  to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted  than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement <EOS> <SOS>  this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting  the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband <EOS> <SOS>  she had always seen it with pain  but respecting his abilities  and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself  she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook  and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which  in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children  was so highly reprehensible <EOS> <SOS>  but she had never felt so strongly as now  the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents  talents which rightly used  might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife <EOS> <SOS>  when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure  she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment <EOS> <SOS>  their parties abroad were less varied than before  and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them  threw a real gloom over their domestic circle  and  though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense  since the disturbers of her brain were removed  her other sister  from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance  by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp <EOS> <SOS>  upon the whole  therefore  she found  what has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire  did not in taking place  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself <EOS> <SOS>  it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity  to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the present  and prepare for another disappointment <EOS> <SOS>  her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours  which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable  and could she have included jane in the scheme  every part of it would have been perfect <EOS> <SOS>   but it is fortunate   thought she   that i have something to wish for <EOS> <SOS>  were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment would be certain <EOS> <SOS>  but here  by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence  i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized <EOS> <SOS>  a scheme of which every part promises delight  can never be successful  and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation <EOS> <SOS>   when lydia went away  she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always long expected  and always very short <EOS> <SOS>  those to her mother  contained little else  than that they were just returned from the library  where such and such officers had attended them  and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which she would have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry  as mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster called her  and they were going to the camp   and from her correspondence with her sister  there was still less to be learnt  for her letters to kitty  though rather longer  were much too full of lines under the words to be made public <EOS> <SOS>  after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health  good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  everything wore a happier aspect <EOS> <SOS>  the families who had been in town for the winter came back again  and summer finery and summer engagements arose <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity  and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope  that by the following christmas  she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day  unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office  another regiment should be quartered in meryton <EOS> <SOS>  the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a letter arrived from mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july  and must be in london again within a month  and as that left too short a period for them to go so far  and see so much as they had proposed  or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up the lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to the present plan  were to go no farther northward than derbyshire <EOS> <SOS>  in that county  there was enough to be seen  to occupy the chief of their three weeks  and to mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction <EOS> <SOS>  the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life  and where they were now to spend a few days  was probably as great an object of her curiosity  as all the celebrated beauties of matlock  chatsworth  dovedale  or the peak <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on seeing the lakes  and still thought there might have been time enough <EOS> <SOS>  but it was her business to be satisfied  and certainly her temper to be happy  and all was soon right again <EOS> <SOS>  with the mention of derbyshire  there were many ideas connected <EOS> <SOS>  it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner <EOS> <SOS>   but surely   said she   i may enter his county with impunity  and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me <EOS> <SOS>   the period of expectation was now doubled <EOS> <SOS>  four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival <EOS> <SOS>  but they did pass away  and mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  with their four children  did at length appear at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  the children  two girls of six and eight years old  and two younger boys  were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane  who was the general favourite  and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way  teaching them  playing with them  and loving them <EOS> <SOS>  the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn  and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement <EOS> <SOS>  one enjoyment was certain  that of suitableness as companions  a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences  cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure  and affection and intelligence  which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad <EOS> <SOS>  it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire  nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay  oxford  blenheim  warwick  kenelworth  birmingham   c <EOS> <SOS>  are sufficiently known <EOS> <SOS>  a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern <EOS> <SOS>  to the little town of lambton  the scene of mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s former residence  and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained  they bent their steps  after having seen all the principal wonders of the country  and within five miles of lambton  elizabeth found from her aunt  that pemberley was situated <EOS> <SOS>  it was not in their direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it <EOS> <SOS>  in talking over their route the evening before  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner declared his willingness  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation <EOS> <SOS>   my love  should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much <EOS> <SOS>   said her aunt <EOS> <SOS>   a place too  with which so many of your acquaintance are connected <EOS> <SOS>  wickham passed all his youth there  you know <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was distressed <EOS> <SOS>  she felt that she had no business at pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it <EOS> <SOS>  she must own that she was tired of great houses  after going over so many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner abused her stupidity <EOS> <SOS>   if it were merely a fine house richly furnished   said she   i should not care about it myself  but the grounds are delightful <EOS> <SOS>  they have some of the finest woods in the country <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth said no more  but her mind could not acquiesce <EOS> <SOS>  the possibility of meeting mr darcy  while viewing the place  instantly occurred <EOS> <SOS>  it would be dreadful <EOS> <SOS>  she blushed at the very idea  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt  than to run such a risk <EOS> <SOS>  but against this  there were objections  and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource  if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family  were unfavourably answered <EOS> <SOS>  accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name of its proprietor  and with no little alarm  whether the family were down for the summer <EOS> <SOS>  a most welcome negative followed the last question  and her alarms being now removed  she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself  and when the subject was revived the next morning  and she was again applied to  could readily answer  and with a proper air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike to the scheme <EOS> <SOS>  to pemberley  therefore  they were to go <EOS> <SOS>  end of the second volume <EOS> <SOS>   illustration  matlock  pride and prejudice  a novel <EOS> <SOS>  in three volumes <EOS> <SOS>

illustration  dove dale  pride   prejudice <EOS> <SOS>  chapter i <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length they turned in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter <EOS> <SOS>  the park was very large  and contained great variety of ground <EOS> <SOS>  they entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some time through a beautiful wood  stretching over a wide extent <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view <EOS> <SOS>  they gradually ascended for half a mile  and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house  situated on the opposite side of a valley  into which the road with some abruptness wound <EOS> <SOS>  it was a large  handsome  stone building  standing well on rising ground  and backed by a ridge of high woody hills   and in front  a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater  but without any artificial appearance <EOS> <SOS>  its banks were neither formal  nor falsely adorned <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was delighted <EOS> <SOS>  she had never seen a place for which nature had done more  or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste <EOS> <SOS>  they were all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt  that to be mistress of pemberley might be something <EOS> <SOS>  they descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the door  and  while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned <EOS> <SOS>  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken <EOS> <SOS>  on applying to see the place  they were admitted into the hall  and elizabeth  as they waited for the housekeeper  had leisure to wonder at her being where she was <EOS> <SOS>  the housekeeper came  a respectable looking  elderly woman  much less fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding her <EOS> <SOS>  they followed her into the dining parlour <EOS> <SOS>  it was a large  well proportioned room  handsomely fitted up <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  after slightly surveying it  went to a window to enjoy its prospect <EOS> <SOS>  the hill  crowned with wood  from which they had descended  receiving increased abruptness from the distance  was a beautiful object <EOS> <SOS>  every disposition of the ground was good  and she looked on the whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its banks  and the winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  with delight <EOS> <SOS>  as they passed into other rooms  these objects were taking different positions  but from every window there were beauties to be seen <EOS> <SOS>  the rooms were lofty and handsome  and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor  but elizabeth saw  with admiration of his taste  that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of splendor  and more real elegance  than the furniture of rosings <EOS> <SOS>   and of this place   thought she   i might have been mistress <EOS> <SOS>  with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted <EOS> <SOS>  instead of viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt <EOS> <SOS>   but no    recollecting herself    that could never be  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me  i should not have been allowed to invite them <EOS> <SOS>   this was a lucky recollection  it saved her from something like regret <EOS> <SOS>  she longed to enquire of the housekeeper  whether her master were really absent  but had not courage for it <EOS> <SOS>  at length  however  the question was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with alarm  while mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds replied  that he was  adding   but we expect him to morrow  with a large party of friends <EOS> <SOS>   how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day <EOS> <SOS>  her aunt now called her to look at a picture <EOS> <SOS>  she approached  and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended  amongst several other miniatures  over the mantle piece <EOS> <SOS>  her aunt asked her  smilingly  how she liked it <EOS> <SOS>  the housekeeper came forward  and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman  the son of her late master s steward  who had been brought up by him at his own expence <EOS> <SOS>    he is now gone into the army   she added   but i am afraid he has turned out very wild <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth could not return it <EOS> <SOS>   and that   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds  pointing to another of the miniatures   is my master  and very like him <EOS> <SOS>  it was drawn at the same time as the other  about eight years ago <EOS> <SOS>    i have heard much of your master s fine person   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  looking at the picture   it is a handsome face <EOS> <SOS>  but  lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master <EOS> <SOS>   does that young lady know mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth coloured  and said   a little <EOS> <SOS>    and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am <EOS> <SOS>    yes  very handsome <EOS> <SOS>    i am sure  i  know none so handsome  but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this <EOS> <SOS>  this room was my late master s favourite room  and these miniatures are just as they used to be then <EOS> <SOS>  he was very fond of them <EOS> <SOS>   this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham s being among them <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds then directed their attention to one of missarcy  drawn when she was only eight years old <EOS> <SOS>   and is missarcy as handsome as her brother <EOS> <SOS>   said mr gardiner <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  yes  the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so accomplished <EOS> <SOS>   she plays and sings all day long <EOS> <SOS>  in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her  a present from my master  she comes here to morrow with him <EOS> <SOS>   mr gardiner  whose manners were easy and pleasant  encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks  mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds  either from pride or attachment  had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister <EOS> <SOS>   is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year <EOS> <SOS>    not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend half his time here  and missarcy is always down for the summer months <EOS> <SOS>    except   thought elizabeth   when she goes to ramsgate <EOS> <SOS>    if your master would marry  you might see more of him <EOS> <SOS>    yes  sir  but i do not know when  that  will be <EOS> <SOS>  i do not know who is good enough for him <EOS> <SOS>   mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner smiled <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth could not help saying   it is very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think so <EOS> <SOS>    i say no more than the truth  and what every body will say that knows him   replied the other <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth thought this was going pretty far  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added   i have never had a cross word from him in my life  and i have known him ever since he was four years old <EOS> <SOS>   this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite to her ideas <EOS> <SOS>  that he was not a good tempered man  had been her firmest opinion <EOS> <SOS>  her keenest attention was awakened  she longed to hear more  and was grateful to her uncle for saying   there are very few people of whom so much can be said <EOS> <SOS>  you are lucky in having such a master <EOS> <SOS>    yes  sir  i know i am <EOS> <SOS>  if i was to go through the world  i could not meet with a better <EOS> <SOS>  but i have always observed  that they who are good natured when children  are good natured when they grow up  and he was always the sweetest tempered  most generous hearted  boy in the world <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth almost stared at her <EOS> <SOS>    can this be mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   thought she <EOS> <SOS>   his father was an excellent man   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner <EOS> <SOS>   yes  ma am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like him  just as affable to the poor <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for more <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds could interest her on no other point <EOS> <SOS>  she related the subject of the pictures  the dimensions of the rooms  and the price of the furniture  in vain <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner  highly amused by the kind of family prejudice  to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master  soon led again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his many merits  as they proceeded together up the great staircase <EOS> <SOS>   he is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that ever lived <EOS> <SOS>  not like the wild young men now a days  who think of nothing but themselves <EOS> <SOS>  there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name <EOS> <SOS>  some people call him proud  but i am sure i never saw any thing of it <EOS> <SOS>  to my fancy  it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men <EOS> <SOS>    in what an amiable light does this place him <EOS> <SOS>   thought elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   this fine account of him   whispered her aunt  as they walked   is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps we might be deceived <EOS> <SOS>    that is not very likely  our authority was too good <EOS> <SOS>   on reaching the spacious lobby above  they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below  and were informed that it was but just done  to give pleasure to missarcy  who had taken a liking to the room  when last at pemberley <EOS> <SOS>   he is certainly a good brother   said elizabeth  as she walked towards one of the windows <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds anticipated missarcy s delight  when she should enter the room <EOS> <SOS>   and this is always the way with him   she added <EOS> <SOS>    whatever can give his sister any pleasure  is sure to be done in a moment <EOS> <SOS>  there is nothing he would not do for her <EOS> <SOS>   the picture gallery  and two or three of the principal bed rooms  were all that remained to be shewn <EOS> <SOS>  in the former were many good paintings  but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such as had been already visible below  she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of missarcy s  in crayons  whose subjects were usually more interesting  and also more intelligible <EOS> <SOS>  in the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her <EOS> <SOS>  at last it arrested her  and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy  with such a smile over the face  as she remembered to have sometimes seen  when he looked at her <EOS> <SOS>  she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation  and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds informed them  that it had been taken in his father s life time <EOS> <SOS>  there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth s mind  a more gentle sensation towards the original  than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>  the commendation bestowed on him by mr <EOS> <SOS>  reynolds was of no trifling nature <EOS> <SOS>  what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant <EOS> <SOS>  as a brother  a landlord  a master  she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship <EOS> <SOS>   how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow <EOS> <SOS>   how much of good or evil must be done by him <EOS> <SOS>  every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she stood before the canvas  on which he was represented  and fixed his eyes upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its warmth  and softened its impropriety of expression <EOS> <SOS>  when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen  they returned down stairs  and taking leave of the housekeeper  were consigned over to the gardener  who met them at the hall door <EOS> <SOS>  as they walked across the lawn towards the river  elizabeth turned back to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building  the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road  which led behind it to the stables <EOS> <SOS>  they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was his appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight <EOS> <SOS>  their eyes instantly met  and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush <EOS> <SOS>  he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced towards the party  and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of perfect composure  at least of perfect civility <EOS> <SOS>  she had instinctively turned away  but  stopping on his approach  received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome <EOS> <SOS>  had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy  the gardener s expression of surprise  on beholding his master  must immediately have told it <EOS> <SOS>  they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece  who  astonished and confused  scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family <EOS> <SOS>  amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted  every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there  recurring to her mind  the few minutes in which they continued together  were some of the most uncomfortable of her life <EOS> <SOS>  nor did he seem much more at ease  when he spoke  his accent had none of its usual sedateness  and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn  and of her stay in derbyshire  so often  and in so hurried a way  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts <EOS> <SOS>  at length  every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a few moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected himself  and took leave <EOS> <SOS>  the others then joined her  and expressed their admiration of his figure  but elizabeth heard not a word  and  wholly engrossed by her own feelings  followed them in silence <EOS> <SOS>  she was overpowered by shame and vexation <EOS> <SOS>  her coming there was the most unfortunate  the most ill judged thing in the world <EOS> <SOS>  how strange must it appear to him <EOS> <SOS>  in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man <EOS> <SOS>  it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  why did she come <EOS> <SOS>  or  why did he thus come a day before he was expected <EOS> <SOS>  had they been only ten minutes sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination  for it was plain that he was that moment arrived  that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage <EOS> <SOS>  she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting <EOS> <SOS>  and his behaviour  so strikingly altered   what could it mean <EOS> <SOS>  that he should even speak to her was amazing <EOS> <SOS>   but to speak with such civility  to enquire after her family <EOS> <SOS>  never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified  never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting <EOS> <SOS>  what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park  when he put his letter into her hand <EOS> <SOS>  she knew not what to think  nor how to account for it <EOS> <SOS>  they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water  and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and  though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out  she distinguished no part of the scene <EOS> <SOS>  her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house  whichever it might be  where mr darcy then was <EOS> <SOS>  she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind  in what manner he thought of her  and whether  in defiance of every thing  she was still dear to him <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps he had been civil  only because he felt himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice  which was not like ease <EOS> <SOS>  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her  she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her with composure <EOS> <SOS>  at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself <EOS> <SOS>  they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a while  ascended some of the higher grounds  whence  in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many charming views of the valley  the opposite hills  with the long range of woods overspreading many  and occasionally part of the stream <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park  but feared it might be beyond a walk <EOS> <SOS>  with a triumphant smile  they were told  that it was ten miles round <EOS> <SOS>  it settled the matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which brought them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  to the edge of the water  in one of its narrowest parts <EOS> <SOS>  they crossed it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air of the scene  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited  and the valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed room only for the stream  and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth longed to explore its windings  but when they had crossed the bridge  and perceived their distance from the house  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  who was not a great walker  could go no farther  and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible <EOS> <SOS>  her niece was  therefore  obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but their progress was slow  for mr gardiner  though seldom able to indulge the taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water  and talking to the man about them  that he advanced but little <EOS> <SOS>  whilst wandering on in this slow manner  they were again surprised  and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first  by the sight of mr darcy approaching them  and at no great distance <EOS> <SOS>  the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before they met <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more prepared for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness  if he really intended to meet them <EOS> <SOS>  for a few moments  indeed  she felt that he would probably strike into some other path <EOS> <SOS>  this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view  the turning past  he was immediately before them <EOS> <SOS>  with a glance she saw  that he had lost none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his politeness  she began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  but she had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her  might be mischievously construed <EOS> <SOS>  her colour changed  and she said no more <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing  he asked her  if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends <EOS> <SOS>  this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared  and she could hardly suppress a smile  at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people  against whom his pride had revolted  in his offer to herself <EOS> <SOS>   what will be his surprise   thought she   when he knows who they are <EOS> <SOS>  he takes them now for people of fashion <EOS> <SOS>   the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named their relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to see how he bore it  and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions <EOS> <SOS>  that he was  surprised  by the connexion was evident  he sustained it however with fortitude  and so far from going away  turned back with them  and entered into conversation with mr gardiner <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth could not but be pleased  could not but triumph <EOS> <SOS>  it was consoling  that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush <EOS> <SOS>  she listened most attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his intelligence  his taste  or his good manners <EOS> <SOS>  the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr darcy invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as often as he chose  while he continued in the neighbourhood  offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle  and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of her wonder <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth said nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment must be all for herself <EOS> <SOS>  her astonishment  however  was extreme  and continually was she repeating   why is he so altered <EOS> <SOS>  from what can it proceed <EOS> <SOS>  it cannot be for  me   it cannot be for  my  sake that his manners are thus softened <EOS> <SOS>  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this <EOS> <SOS>  it is impossible that he should still love me <EOS> <SOS>   after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the two gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant  there chanced to be a little alteration <EOS> <SOS>  it originated in mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the morning  found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support  and consequently preferred her husband s <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy took her place by her niece  and they walked on together <EOS> <SOS>  after a short silence  the lady first spoke <EOS> <SOS>  she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place  and accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been very unexpected   for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow  and indeed  before we left bakewell  we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country <EOS> <SOS>   he acknowledged the truth of it all  and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling <EOS> <SOS>   they will join me early to morrow   he continued   and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you   mr bingley and his sisters <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth answered only by a slight bow <EOS> <SOS>  her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley s name had been last mentioned between them  and if she might judge from his complexion   his  mind was not very differently engaged <EOS> <SOS>   there is also one other person in the party   he continued after a pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you   will you allow me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton <EOS> <SOS>   the surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it <EOS> <SOS>  she immediately felt that whatever desire missarcy might have of being acquainted with her  must be the work of her brother  and without looking farther  it was satisfactory  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her <EOS> <SOS>  they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was flattered and pleased <EOS> <SOS>  his wish of introducing his sister to her  was a compliment of the highest kind <EOS> <SOS>  they soon outstripped the others  and when they had reached the carriage  mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind <EOS> <SOS>  he then asked her to walk into the house  but she declared herself not tired  and they stood together on the lawn <EOS> <SOS>  at such a time  much might have been said  and silence was very awkward <EOS> <SOS>  she wanted to talk  but there seemed an embargo on every subject <EOS> <SOS>  at last she recollected that she had been travelling  and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance <EOS> <SOS>  yet time and her aunt moved slowly  and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te   t te was over <EOS> <SOS>  on mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s coming up  they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined  and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off  elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house <EOS> <SOS>  the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected <EOS> <SOS>   he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and unassuming   said her uncle <EOS> <SOS>   there  is  something a little stately in him to be sure   replied her aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not unbecoming <EOS> <SOS>  i can now say with the housekeeper  that though some people may call him proud   i  have seen nothing of it <EOS> <SOS>    i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us <EOS> <SOS>  it was more than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no necessity for such attention <EOS> <SOS>  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling <EOS> <SOS>    to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as wickham  or rather he has not wickham s countenance  for his features are perfectly good <EOS> <SOS>  but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before  and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning <EOS> <SOS>   but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities   replied her uncle <EOS> <SOS>   your great men often are  and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing  as he might change his mind another day  and warn me off his grounds <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character  but said nothing <EOS> <SOS>   from what we have seen of him   continued mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner   i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body  as he has done by poor wickham <EOS> <SOS>  he has not an ill natured look <EOS> <SOS>  on the contrary  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks <EOS> <SOS>  and there is something of dignity in his countenance  that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart <EOS> <SOS>  but to be sure  the good lady who shewed us the house  did give him a most flaming character <EOS> <SOS>  i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes <EOS> <SOS>  but he is a liberal master  i suppose  and  that  in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them to understand  in as guarded a manner as she could  that by what she had heard from his relations in kent  his actions were capable of a very different construction  and that his character was by no means so faulty  nor wickham s so amiable  as they had been considered in hertfordshire <EOS> <SOS>  in confirmation of this  she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected  without actually naming her authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave way to the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs  to think of any thing else <EOS> <SOS>  fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk  they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance  and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance <EOS> <SOS>  the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends  and she could do nothing but think  and think with wonder  of mr darcy s civility  and above all  of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister <EOS> <SOS>  chapter ii <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her  the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning <EOS> <SOS>  but her conclusion was false  for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton  these visitors came <EOS> <SOS>  they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends  and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window  and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle  driving up the street <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth immediately recognising the livery  guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations  by acquainting them with the honour which she expected <EOS> <SOS>  her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke  joined to the circumstance itself  and many of the circumstances of the preceding day  opened to them a new idea on the business <EOS> <SOS>  nothing had ever suggested it before  but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter  than by supposing a partiality for their niece <EOS> <SOS>  while these newly born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing <EOS> <SOS>  she was quite amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of disquiet  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour  and more than commonly anxious to please  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her <EOS> <SOS>  she retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she walked up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt  as made every thing worse <EOS> <SOS>  missarcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable introduction took place <EOS> <SOS>  with astonishment did elizabeth see  that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself <EOS> <SOS>  since her being at lambton  she had heard that missarcy was exceedingly proud  but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her  that she was only exceedingly shy <EOS> <SOS>  she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable <EOS> <SOS>  missarcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and  though little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her appearance womanly and graceful <EOS> <SOS>  she was less handsome than her brother  but there was sense and good humour in her face  and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been  was much relieved by discerning such different feelings <EOS> <SOS>  they had not been long together  before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time to express her satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he entered the room <EOS> <SOS>  all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away  but  had she still felt any  it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself  on seeing her again <EOS> <SOS>  he enquired in a friendly  though general way  after her family  and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done <EOS> <SOS>  to mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself <EOS> <SOS>  they had long wished to see him <EOS> <SOS>  the whole party before them  indeed  excited a lively attention <EOS> <SOS>  the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece  directed their observation towards each with an earnest  though guarded  enquiry  and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love <EOS> <SOS>  of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  on her side  had much to do <EOS> <SOS>  she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her own  and to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter object  where she feared most to fail  she was most sure of success  for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was ready  georgiana was eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased <EOS> <SOS>  in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  and oh <EOS> <SOS>  how ardently did she long to know  whether any of his were directed in a like manner <EOS> <SOS>  sometimes she could fancy  that he talked less than on former occasions  and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her  he was trying to trace a resemblance <EOS> <SOS>  but  though this might be imaginary  she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to missarcy  who had been set up as a rival of jane <EOS> <SOS>  no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard <EOS> <SOS>  nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister <EOS> <SOS>  on this point she was soon satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a recollection of jane  not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared <EOS> <SOS>  he observed to her  at a moment when the others were talking together  and in a tone which had something of real regret  that it  was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her   and  before she could reply  he added   it is above eight months <EOS> <SOS>  we have not met since the 26th of november  when we were all dancing together at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he afterwards took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of the rest  whether  all  her sisters were at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  there was not much in the question  nor in the preceding remark  but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning <EOS> <SOS>  it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself  but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an expression of general complaisance  and in all that he said  she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions  as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed  however temporary its existence might prove  had at least outlived one day <EOS> <SOS>  when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance  and courting the good opinion of people  with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace  when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage  the difference  the change was so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible <EOS> <SOS>  never  even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield  or his dignified relations at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to please  so free from self consequence  or unbending reserve as now  when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed  would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings <EOS> <SOS>  their visitors staid with them above half an hour  and when they arose to depart  mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  and missennet  to dinner at pemberley  before they left the country <EOS> <SOS>  missarcy  though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations  readily obeyed <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner looked at her niece  desirous of knowing how  she   whom the invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its acceptance  but elizabeth had turned away her head <EOS> <SOS>  presuming  however  that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment  than any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who was fond of society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she ventured to engage for her attendance  and the day after the next was fixed on <EOS> <SOS>  bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again  having still a great deal to say to her  and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister  was pleased  and on this account  as well as some others  found herself  when their visitors left them  capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction  though while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been little <EOS> <SOS>  eager to be alone  and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt  she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress <EOS> <SOS>  but she had no reason to fear mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s curiosity  it was not their wish to force her communication <EOS> <SOS>  it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of  it was evident that he was very much in love with her <EOS> <SOS>  they saw much to interest  but nothing to justify enquiry <EOS> <SOS>  of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and  as far as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find <EOS> <SOS>  they could not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn his character from their own feelings  and his servant s report  without any reference to any other account  the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known  would not have recognised it for mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  there was now an interest  however  in believing the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible  that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old  and whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be hastily rejected <EOS> <SOS>  neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends  that could materially lessen its weight <EOS> <SOS>  they had nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably had  and if not  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town  where the family did not visit <EOS> <SOS>  it was acknowledged  however  that he was a liberal man  and did much good among the poor <EOS> <SOS>  with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation  for though the chief of his concerns  with the son of his patron  were imperfectly understood  it was yet a well known fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he had left many debts behind him  which mr darcy afterwards discharged <EOS> <SOS>  as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last  and the evening  though as it passed it seemed long  was not long enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion  and she lay awake two whole hours  endeavouring to make them out <EOS> <SOS>  she certainly did not hate him <EOS> <SOS>  no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  that could be so called <EOS> <SOS>  the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings  and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony so highly in his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light  which yesterday had produced <EOS> <SOS>  but above all  above respect and esteem  there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked <EOS> <SOS>  it was gratitude <EOS> <SOS>   gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  but for loving her still well enough  to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection <EOS> <SOS>  he who  she had been persuaded  would avoid her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental meeting  most eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any indelicate display of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where their two selves only were concerned  was soliciting the good opinion of her friends  and bent on making her known to his sister <EOS> <SOS>  such a change in a man of so much pride  excited not only astonishment but gratitude  for to love  ardent love  it must be attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be exactly defined <EOS> <SOS>  she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to him  she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself  and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power  which her fancy told her she still possessed  of bringing on the renewal of his addresses <EOS> <SOS>  it had been settled in the evening  between the aunt and niece  that such a striking civility as missarcy s  in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had reached it only to a late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though it could not be equalled  by some exertion of politeness on their side  and  consequently  that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning <EOS> <SOS>  they were  therefore  to go <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was pleased  though  when she asked herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast <EOS> <SOS>  the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon <EOS> <SOS>  chapter iii <EOS> <SOS>  convinced as elizabeth now was that missingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side  the acquaintance would now be renewed <EOS> <SOS>  on reaching the house  they were shewn through the hall into the saloon  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer <EOS> <SOS>  its windows opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house  and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn <EOS> <SOS>  in this room they were received by missarcy  who was sitting there with mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley  and the lady with whom she lived in london <EOS> <SOS>  georgiana s reception of them was very civil  but attended with all that embarrassment which  though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior  the belief of her being proud and reserved <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner and her niece  however  did her justice  and pitied her <EOS> <SOS>  by mr <EOS> <SOS>  hurst and missingley  they were noticed only by a curtsey  and on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such pauses must always be  succeeded for a few moments <EOS> <SOS>  it was first broken by mr <EOS> <SOS>  annesley  a genteel  agreeable looking woman  whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse  proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others  and between her and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  with occasional help from elizabeth  the conversation was carried on <EOS> <SOS>  missarcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a short sentence  when there was least danger of its being heard <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by missingley  and that she could not speak a word  especially to missarcy  without calling her attention <EOS> <SOS>  this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter  had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much <EOS> <SOS>  her own thoughts were employing her <EOS> <SOS>  she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room <EOS> <SOS>  she wished  she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them  and whether she wished or feared it most  she could scarcely determine <EOS> <SOS>  after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour  without hearing missingley s voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family <EOS> <SOS>  she answered with equal indifference and brevity  and the other said no more <EOS> <SOS>  the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all the finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mr <EOS> <SOS>  annesley to missarcy had been given  to remind her of her post <EOS> <SOS>  there was now employment for the whole party  for though they could not all talk  they could all eat  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes  nectarines  and peaches  soon collected them round the table <EOS> <SOS>  while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  and then  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate  she began to regret that he came <EOS> <SOS>  he had been some time with mr gardiner  who  with two or three other gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning <EOS> <SOS>  no sooner did he appear  than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed   a resolution the more necessary to be made  but perhaps not the more easily kept  because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them  and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room <EOS> <SOS>  in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in missingley s  in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over <EOS> <SOS>  missarcy  on her brother s entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted  and forwarded  as much as possible  every attempt at conversation on either side <EOS> <SOS>  missingley saw all this likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the first opportunity of saying  with sneering civility   pray  missliza  are not the     shire militia removed from meryton <EOS> <SOS>  they must be a great loss to  your  family <EOS> <SOS>   in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name  but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts  and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress  but  exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack  she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone <EOS> <SOS>  while she spoke  an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion  earnestly looking at her  and his sister overcome with confusion  and unable to lift up her eyes <EOS> <SOS>  had missingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth  by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion  and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities  by which some part of her family were connected with that corps <EOS> <SOS>  not a syllable had ever reached her of missarcy s meditated elopement <EOS> <SOS>  to no creature had it been revealed  where secresy was possible  except to elizabeth  and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it  from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming hereafter her own <EOS> <SOS>  he had certainly formed such a plan  and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from missennet  it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his emotion  and as missingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not approach nearer to wickham  georgiana also recovered in time  though not enough to be able to speak any more <EOS> <SOS>  her brother  whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely recollected her interest in the affair  and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth  seemed to have fixed them on her more  and more cheerfully <EOS> <SOS>  their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned  and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage  missingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person  behaviour  and dress <EOS> <SOS>  but georgiana would not join her <EOS> <SOS>  her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour  his judgment could not err  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth  as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable <EOS> <SOS>  when darcy returned to the saloon  missingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister <EOS> <SOS>   how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning  mr darcy   she cried   i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter <EOS> <SOS>  she is grown so brown and coarse <EOS> <SOS>  louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again <EOS> <SOS>   however little mr darcy might have liked such an address  he contented himself with coolly replying  that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned   no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer <EOS> <SOS>   for my own part   she rejoined   i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her <EOS> <SOS>  her face is too thin  her complexion has no brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome <EOS> <SOS>  her nose wants character  there is nothing marked in its lines <EOS> <SOS>  her teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them <EOS> <SOS>  they have a sharp  shrewish look  which i do not like at all  and in her air altogether  there is a self sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable <EOS> <SOS>   persuaded as missingley was that darcy admired elizabeth  this was not the best method of recommending herself  but angry people are not always wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled  she had all the success she expected <EOS> <SOS>  he was resolutely silent however  and  from a determination of making him speak  she continued   i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been dining at netherfield    she  a beauty <EOS> <SOS>   i should as soon call her mother a wit <EOS> <SOS>   but afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time <EOS> <SOS>    yes   replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but  that  was only when i first knew her  for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>   he then went away  and missingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred  during their visit  as they returned  except what had particularly interested them both <EOS> <SOS>  the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed  except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention <EOS> <SOS>  they talked of his sister  his friends  his house  his fruit  of every thing but himself  yet elizabeth was longing to know what mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner thought of him  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject <EOS> <SOS>  chapter iv <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane  on their first arrival at lambton  and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there  but on the third  her repining was over  and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once  on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was not surprised at it  as jane had written the direction remarkably ill <EOS> <SOS>  they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off by themselves <EOS> <SOS>  the one missent must be first attended to  it had been written five days ago <EOS> <SOS>  the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements  with such news as the country afforded  but the latter half  which was dated a day later  and written in evident agitation  gave more important intelligence <EOS> <SOS>  it was to this effect        since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of alarming      you  be assured that we are all well <EOS> <SOS>  what i have to say relates to      poor lydia <EOS> <SOS>  an express came at twelve last night  just as we were      all gone to bed  from colonel forster  to inform us that she was      gone off to scotland with one of his officers  to own the truth       with wickham <EOS> <SOS>   imagine our surprise <EOS> <SOS>  to kitty  however  it does not      seem so wholly unexpected <EOS> <SOS>  i am very  very sorry <EOS> <SOS>  so imprudent a      match on both sides <EOS> <SOS>   but i am willing to hope the best  and that      his character has been misunderstood <EOS> <SOS>  thoughtless and indiscreet i      can easily believe him  but this step  and let us rejoice over it       marks nothing bad at heart <EOS> <SOS>  his choice is disinterested at least       for he must know my father can give her nothing <EOS> <SOS>  our poor mother      is sadly grieved <EOS> <SOS>  my father bears it better <EOS> <SOS>  how thankful am i       that we never let them know what has been said against him  we must      forget it ourselves <EOS> <SOS>  they were off saturday night about twelve  as      is conjectured  but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight <EOS> <SOS>  the express was sent off directly <EOS> <SOS>  my dear lizzy  they must      have passed within ten miles of us <EOS> <SOS>  colonel forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon <EOS> <SOS>  lydia left a few lines for his wife       informing her of their intention <EOS> <SOS>  i must conclude  for i cannot be      long from my poor mother <EOS> <SOS>  i am afraid you will not be able to make      it out  but i hardly know what i have written <EOS> <SOS>   without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely knowing what she felt  elizabeth on finishing this letter  instantly seized the other  and opening it with the utmost impatience  read as follows  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first <EOS> <SOS>        by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried      letter  i wish this may be more intelligible  but though not      confined for time  my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer      for being coherent <EOS> <SOS>  dearest lizzy  i hardly know what i would      write  but i have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed <EOS> <SOS>       imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia      would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place  for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland <EOS> <SOS>       colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton the day      before  not many hours after the express <EOS> <SOS>  though lydia s short      letter to mr <EOS> <SOS>  f <EOS> <SOS>  gave them to understand that they were going to      gretna green  something was dropped by denny expressing his belief      that w <EOS> <SOS>  never intended to go there  or to marry lydia at all  which      was repeated to colonel f <EOS> <SOS>  who instantly taking the alarm  set off      from b <EOS> <SOS>  intending to trace their route <EOS> <SOS>  he did trace them easily to      clapham  but no farther  for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from epsom <EOS> <SOS>  all that is known after this is  that they were seen      to continue the london road <EOS> <SOS>  i know not what to think <EOS> <SOS>  after making      every possible enquiry on that side london  colonel f <EOS> <SOS>  came on into      hertfordshire  anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes  and at      the inns in barnet and hatfield  but without any success  no such      people had been seen to pass through <EOS> <SOS>  with the kindest concern he      came on to longbourn  and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart <EOS> <SOS>  i am sincerely grieved for him and      mr <EOS> <SOS>  f <EOS> <SOS>  but no one can throw any blame on them <EOS> <SOS>  our distress  my      dear lizzy  is very great <EOS> <SOS>  my father and mother believe the worst       but i cannot think so ill of him <EOS> <SOS>  many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan  and even if  he  could form such a design      against a young woman of lydia s connections  which is not likely       can i suppose her so lost to every thing <EOS> <SOS>   impossible <EOS> <SOS>  i grieve to      find  however  that colonel f <EOS> <SOS>  is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage  he shook his head when i expressed my hopes  and said he      feared w <EOS> <SOS>  was not a man to be trusted <EOS> <SOS>  my poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room <EOS> <SOS>  could she exert herself it would be better  but      this is not to be expected  and as to my father  i never in my life      saw him so affected <EOS> <SOS>  poor kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment  but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder <EOS> <SOS>  i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes  but now as the first shock      is over  shall i own that i long for your return <EOS> <SOS>  i am not so      selfish  however  as to press for it  if inconvenient <EOS> <SOS>  adieu <EOS> <SOS>  i      take up my pen again to do  what i have just told you i would not       but circumstances are such  that i cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here  as soon as possible <EOS> <SOS>  i know my dear uncle and      aunt so well  that i am not afraid of requesting it  though i have      still something more to ask of the former <EOS> <SOS>  my father is going to      london with colonel forster instantly  to try to discover her <EOS> <SOS>  what      he means to do  i am sure i know not  but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way  and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again      to morrow evening <EOS> <SOS>  in such an exigence my uncle s advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world  he will immediately      comprehend what i must feel  and i rely upon his goodness <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  where  where is my uncle <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth  darting from her seat as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him  without losing a moment of the time so precious  but as she reached the door  it was opened by a servant  and mr darcy appeared <EOS> <SOS>  her pale face and impetuous manner made him start  and before he could recover himself enough to speak  she  in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation  hastily exclaimed   i beg your pardon  but i must leave you <EOS> <SOS>  i must find mr gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i have not an instant to lose <EOS> <SOS>    good god <EOS> <SOS>  what is the matter <EOS> <SOS>   cried he  with more feeling than politeness  then recollecting himself   i will not detain you a minute  but let me  or let the servant  go after mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner <EOS> <SOS>  you are not well enough   you cannot go yourself <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her  and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them <EOS> <SOS>  calling back the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to fetch his master and mistress home  instantly <EOS> <SOS>  on his quitting the room  she sat down  unable to support herself  and looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for darcy to leave her  or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and commiseration   let me call your maid <EOS> <SOS>  is there nothing you could take  to give you present relief <EOS> <SOS>   a glass of wine   shall i get you one <EOS> <SOS>   you are very ill <EOS> <SOS>    no  i thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself <EOS> <SOS>   there is nothing the matter with me <EOS> <SOS>  i am quite well <EOS> <SOS>  i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn <EOS> <SOS>   she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes could not speak another word <EOS> <SOS>  darcy  in wretched suspense  could only say something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her in compassionate silence <EOS> <SOS>  at length  she spoke again <EOS> <SOS>   i have just had a letter from jane  with such dreadful news <EOS> <SOS>  it cannot be concealed from any one <EOS> <SOS>  my youngest sister has left all her friends  has eloped   has thrown herself into the power of  of mr wickham <EOS> <SOS>  they are gone off together from brighton <EOS> <SOS>   you  know him too well to doubt the rest <EOS> <SOS>  she has no money  no connections  nothing that can tempt him to  she is lost for ever <EOS> <SOS>   darcy was fixed in astonishment <EOS> <SOS>   when i consider   she added  in a yet more agitated voice   that  i  might have prevented it <EOS> <SOS>    i  who knew what he was <EOS> <SOS>  had i but explained some part of it only  some part of what i learnt  to my own family <EOS> <SOS>  had his character been known  this could not have happened <EOS> <SOS>  but it is all  all too late now <EOS> <SOS>    i am grieved  indeed   cried darcy   grieved  shocked <EOS> <SOS>  but is it certain  absolutely certain <EOS> <SOS>    oh yes <EOS> <SOS>   they left brighton together on sunday night  and were traced almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not gone to scotland <EOS> <SOS>    and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover her <EOS> <SOS>    my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in half an hour <EOS> <SOS>  but nothing can be done  i know very well that nothing can be done <EOS> <SOS>  how is such a man to be worked on <EOS> <SOS>  how are they even to be discovered <EOS> <SOS>  i have not the smallest hope <EOS> <SOS>  it is every way horrible <EOS> <SOS>   darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence <EOS> <SOS>   when  my  eyes were opened to his real character <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  had i known what i ought  what i dared  to do <EOS> <SOS>  but i knew not  i was afraid of doing too much <EOS> <SOS>  wretched  wretched  mistake <EOS> <SOS>   darcy made no answer <EOS> <SOS>  he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow contracted  his air gloomy <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth soon observed  and instantly understood it <EOS> <SOS>  her power was sinking  every thing  must  sink under such a proof of family weakness  such an assurance of the deepest disgrace <EOS> <SOS>  she could neither wonder nor condemn  but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress <EOS> <SOS>  it was  on the contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him  as now  when all love must be vain <EOS> <SOS>  but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her <EOS> <SOS>  lydia  the humiliation  the misery  she was bringing on them all  soon swallowed up every private care  and covering her face with her handkerchief  elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else  and  after a pause of several minutes  was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion  who  in a manner  which though it spoke compassion  spoke likewise restraint  said   i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence  nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay  but real  though unavailing  concern <EOS> <SOS>  would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part  that might offer consolation to such distress <EOS> <SOS>   but i will not torment you with vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks <EOS> <SOS>  this unfortunate affair will  i fear  prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day <EOS> <SOS>    oh  yes <EOS> <SOS>  be so kind as to apologize for us to missarcy <EOS> <SOS>  say that urgent business calls us home immediately <EOS> <SOS>  conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible <EOS> <SOS>   i know it cannot be long <EOS> <SOS>   he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow for her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her relations  with only one serious  parting  look  went away <EOS> <SOS>  as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance  so full of contradictions and varieties  sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance  and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination <EOS> <SOS>  if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection  elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty <EOS> <SOS>  but if otherwise  if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural  in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object  and even before two words have been exchanged  nothing can be said in her defence  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method  in her partiality for wickham  and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment <EOS> <SOS>  be that as it may  she saw him go with regret  and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business <EOS> <SOS>  never  since reading jane s second letter  had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her <EOS> <SOS>  no one but jane  she thought  could flatter herself with such an expectation <EOS> <SOS>  surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement <EOS> <SOS>  while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind  she was all surprise  all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl  whom it was impossible he could marry for money  and how lydia could ever have attached him  had appeared incomprehensible <EOS> <SOS>  but now it was all too natural <EOS> <SOS>  for such an attachment as this  she might have sufficient charms  and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement  without the intention of marriage  she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey <EOS> <SOS>  she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire  that lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body <EOS> <SOS>  sometimes one officer  sometimes another had been her favourite  as their attentions raised them in her opinion <EOS> <SOS>  her affections had been continually fluctuating  but never without an object <EOS> <SOS>  the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  how acutely did she now feel it <EOS> <SOS>  she was wild to be at home  to hear  to see  to be upon the spot  to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her  in a family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable of exertion  and requiring constant attendance  and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia  her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance  and till he entered the room  the misery of her impatience was severe <EOS> <SOS>  mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner had hurried back in alarm  supposing  by the servant s account  that their niece was taken suddenly ill   but satisfying them instantly on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the postscript of the last  with trembling energy <EOS> <SOS>   though lydia had never been a favourite with them  mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner could not but be deeply affected <EOS> <SOS>  not lydia only  but all were concerned in it  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror  mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth  though expecting no less  thanked him with tears of gratitude  and all three being actuated by one spirit  every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled <EOS> <SOS>  they were to be off as soon as possible <EOS> <SOS>   but what is to be done about pemberley <EOS> <SOS>   cried mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner <EOS> <SOS>   john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us   was it so <EOS> <SOS>    yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement <EOS> <SOS>   that  is all settled <EOS> <SOS>    that is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her room to prepare <EOS> <SOS>   and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth <EOS> <SOS>  oh  that i knew how it was <EOS> <SOS>   but wishes were vain  or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour <EOS> <SOS>  had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle  she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself  but she had her share of business as well as her aunt  and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton  with false excuses for their sudden departure <EOS> <SOS>  an hour  however  saw the whole completed  and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn  nothing remained to be done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of the morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  chapter v <EOS> <SOS>   i have been thinking it over again  elizabeth   said her uncle  as they drove from the town   and really  upon serious consideration  i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter <EOS> <SOS>  it appears to me so very unlikely  that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was actually staying in his colonel s family  that i am strongly inclined to hope the best <EOS> <SOS>  could he expect that her friends would not step forward <EOS> <SOS>  could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster <EOS> <SOS>  his temptation is not adequate to the risk <EOS> <SOS>    do you really think so <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth  brightening up for a moment <EOS> <SOS>   upon my word   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner   i begin to be of your uncle s opinion <EOS> <SOS>  it is really too great a violation of decency  honour  and interest  for him to be guilty of it <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot think so very ill of wickham <EOS> <SOS>  can you  yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him up  as to believe him capable of it <EOS> <SOS>    not perhaps of neglecting his own interest <EOS> <SOS>  but of every other neglect i can believe him capable <EOS> <SOS>  if  indeed  it should be so <EOS> <SOS>  but i dare not hope it <EOS> <SOS>  why should they not go on to scotland  if that had been the case <EOS> <SOS>    in the first place   replied mr gardiner   there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption <EOS> <SOS>  and  besides  no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road <EOS> <SOS>    well  then  supposing them to be in london <EOS> <SOS>  they may be there  though for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptionable purpose <EOS> <SOS>  it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side  and it might strike them that they could be more economically  though less expeditiously  married in london  than in scotland <EOS> <SOS>    but why all this secrecy <EOS> <SOS>  why any fear of detection <EOS> <SOS>  why must their marriage be private <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  no  no  this is not likely <EOS> <SOS>  his most particular friend  you see by jane s account  was persuaded of his never intending to marry her <EOS> <SOS>  wickham will never marry a woman without some money <EOS> <SOS>  he cannot afford it <EOS> <SOS>  and what claims has lydia  what attractions has she beyond youth  health  and good humour  that could make him for her sake  forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well <EOS> <SOS>  as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce <EOS> <SOS>  but as to your other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good <EOS> <SOS>  lydia has no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from my father s behaviour  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family  that  he  would do as little  and think as little about it  as any father could do  in such a matter <EOS> <SOS>    but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him  as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage <EOS> <SOS>    it does seem  and it is most shocking indeed   replied elizabeth  with tears in her eyes   that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt <EOS> <SOS>  but  really  i know not what to say <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps i am not doing her justice <EOS> <SOS>  but she is very young  she has never been taught to think on serious subjects  and for the last half year  nay  for a twelvemonth  she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity <EOS> <SOS>  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in her way <EOS> <SOS>  since the     shire were first quartered in meryton  nothing but love  flirtation  and officers  have been in her head <EOS> <SOS>  she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject  to give greater  what shall i call it <EOS> <SOS>  susceptibility to her feelings  which are naturally lively enough <EOS> <SOS>  and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman <EOS> <SOS>    but you see that jane   said her aunt   does not think so ill of wickham  as to believe him capable of the attempt <EOS> <SOS>    of whom does jane ever think ill <EOS> <SOS>  and who is there  whatever might be their former conduct  that she would believe capable of such an attempt  till it were proved against them <EOS> <SOS>  but jane knows  as well as i do  what wickham really is <EOS> <SOS>  we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word <EOS> <SOS>  that he has neither integrity nor honour <EOS> <SOS>  that he is as false and deceitful  as he is insinuating <EOS> <SOS>    and do you really know all this <EOS> <SOS>   cried mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive <EOS> <SOS>   i do  indeed   replied elizabeth  colouring <EOS> <SOS>   i told you the other day  of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy  and you  yourself  when last at longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke of the man  who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him <EOS> <SOS>  and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty  which it is not worth while to relate  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless <EOS> <SOS>  from what he said of missarcy  i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved  disagreeable girl <EOS> <SOS>  yet he knew to the contrary himself <EOS> <SOS>  he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her <EOS> <SOS>    but does lydia know nothing of this <EOS> <SOS>  can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand <EOS> <SOS>    oh  yes <EOS> <SOS>   that  that is the worst of all <EOS> <SOS>  till i was in kent  and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation  colonel fitzwilliam  i was ignorant of the truth myself <EOS> <SOS>  and when i returned home  the     shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time <EOS> <SOS>  as that was the case  neither jane  to whom i related the whole  nor i  thought it necessary to make our knowledge public  for of what use could it apparently be to any one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him  should then be overthrown <EOS> <SOS>  and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster  the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me <EOS> <SOS>  that  she  could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head <EOS> <SOS>  that such a consequence as  this  should ensue  you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts <EOS> <SOS>    when they all removed to brighton  therefore  you had no reason  i suppose  to believe them fond of each other <EOS> <SOS>    not the slightest <EOS> <SOS>  i can remember no symptom of affection on either side  and had any thing of the kind been perceptible  you must be aware that ours is not a family  on which it could be thrown away <EOS> <SOS>  when first he entered the corps  she was ready enough to admire him  but so we all were <EOS> <SOS>  every girl in  or near meryton  was out of her senses about him for the first two months  but he never distinguished  her  by any particular attention  and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her favourites <EOS> <SOS>                                            it may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could be added to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this interesting subject  by its repeated discussion  no other could detain them from it long  during the whole of the journey <EOS> <SOS>  from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent <EOS> <SOS>  fixed there by the keenest of all anguish  self reproach  she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness <EOS> <SOS>  they travelled as expeditiously as possible  and sleeping one night on the road  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day <EOS> <SOS>  it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations <EOS> <SOS>  the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were standing on the steps of the house  as they entered the paddock  and when the carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces  and displayed itself over their whole bodies  in a variety of capers and frisks  was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them an hasty kiss  hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment  immediately met her <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears filled the eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives <EOS> <SOS>   not yet   replied jane <EOS> <SOS>   but now that my dear uncle is come  i hope every thing will be well <EOS> <SOS>    is my father in town <EOS> <SOS>    yes  he went on tuesday as i wrote you word <EOS> <SOS>    and have you heard from him often <EOS> <SOS>    we have heard only once <EOS> <SOS>  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday  to say that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his directions  which i particularly begged him to do <EOS> <SOS>  he merely added  that he should not write again  till he had something of importance to mention <EOS> <SOS>    and my mother  how is she <EOS> <SOS>  how are you all <EOS> <SOS>    my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are greatly shaken <EOS> <SOS>  she is up stairs  and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all <EOS> <SOS>  she does not yet leave her dressing room <EOS> <SOS>  mary and kitty  thank heaven <EOS> <SOS>  are quite well <EOS> <SOS>    but you  how are you <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   you look pale <EOS> <SOS>  how much you must have gone through <EOS> <SOS>   her sister  however  assured her  of her being perfectly well  and their conversation  which had been passing while mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner were engaged with their children  was now put an end to  by the approach of the whole party <EOS> <SOS>  jane ran to her uncle and aunt  and welcomed and thanked them both  with alternate smiles and tears <EOS> <SOS>  when they were all in the drawing room  the questions which elizabeth had already asked  were of course repeated by the others  and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give <EOS> <SOS>  the sanguine hope of good  however  which the benevolence of her heart suggested  had not yet deserted her  she still expected that it would all end well  and that every morning would bring some letter  either from lydia or her father  to explain their proceedings  and perhaps announce the marriage <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few minutes conversation together  received them exactly as might be expected  with tears and lamentations of regret  invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham  and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage  blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing <EOS> <SOS>   if i had been able   said she   to carry my point of going to brighton  with all my family   this  would not have happened  but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her <EOS> <SOS>  why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing  if she had been well looked after <EOS> <SOS>  i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her  but i was over ruled  as i always am <EOS> <SOS>  poor dear child <EOS> <SOS>  and now here s mr bennet gone away  and i know he will fight wickham  wherever he meets him  and then he will be killed  and what is to become of us all <EOS> <SOS>  the collinses will turn us out  before he is cold in his grave  and if you are not kind to us  brother  i do not know what we shall do <EOS> <SOS>   they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr gardiner  after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family  told her that he meant to be in london the very next day  and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia <EOS> <SOS>   do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it as certain <EOS> <SOS>  it is not quite a week since they left brighton <EOS> <SOS>  in a few days more  we may gain some news of them  and till we know that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not let us give the matter over as lost <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as i get to town  i shall go to my brother  and make him come home with me to gracechurch street  and then we may consult together as to what is to be done <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear brother   replied mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   that is exactly what i could most wish for <EOS> <SOS>  and now do  when you get to town  find them out  wherever they may be  and if they are not married already   make  them marry <EOS> <SOS>  and as for wedding clothes  do not let them wait for that  but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses  to buy them  after they are married <EOS> <SOS>  and  above all things  keep mr bennet from fighting <EOS> <SOS>  tell him what a dreadful state i am in   that i am frightened out of my wits  and have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me  such spasms in my side  and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that i can get no rest by night nor by day <EOS> <SOS>  and tell my dear lydia  not to give any directions about her clothes  till she has seen me  for she does not know which are the best warehouses <EOS> <SOS>  oh  brother  how kind you are <EOS> <SOS>  i know you will contrive it all <EOS> <SOS>   but mr gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation to her  as well in her hopes as her fears  and  after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table  they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper  who attended  in the absence of her daughters <EOS> <SOS>  though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not attempt to oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants  while they waited at table  and judged it better that  one  only of the household  and the one whom they could most trust  should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject <EOS> <SOS>  in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments  to make their appearance before <EOS> <SOS>  one came from her books  and the other from her toilette <EOS> <SOS>  the faces of both  however  were tolerably calm  and no change was visible in either  except that the loss of her favourite sister  or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business  had given something more of fretfulness than usual  to the accents of kitty <EOS> <SOS>  as for mary  she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table   this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much talked of <EOS> <SOS>  but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other  the balm of sisterly consolation <EOS> <SOS>   then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she added   unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from it this useful lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable  that one false step involves her in endless ruin  that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful   and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much oppressed to make any reply <EOS> <SOS>  mary  however  continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them <EOS> <SOS>  in the afternoon  the two elder missennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries  which jane was equally eager to satisfy <EOS> <SOS>  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event  which elizabeth considered as all but certain  and missennet could not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued the subject  by saying   but tell me all and every thing about it  which i have not already heard <EOS> <SOS>  give me farther particulars <EOS> <SOS>  what did colonel forster say <EOS> <SOS>  had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place <EOS> <SOS>  they must have seen them together for ever <EOS> <SOS>    colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality  especially on lydia s side  but nothing to give him any alarm <EOS> <SOS>  i am so grieved for him <EOS> <SOS>  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost <EOS> <SOS>  he  was  coming to us  in order to assure us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland  when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened his journey <EOS> <SOS>    and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry <EOS> <SOS>  did he know of their intending to go off <EOS> <SOS>  had colonel forster seen denny himself <EOS> <SOS>    yes  but when questioned by  him  denny denied knowing any thing of their plan  and would not give his real opinion about it <EOS> <SOS>  he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying  and from  that   i am inclined to hope  he might have been misunderstood before <EOS> <SOS>    and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you entertained a doubt  i suppose  of their being really married <EOS> <SOS>    how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains <EOS> <SOS>  i felt a little uneasy  a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right <EOS> <SOS>  my father and mother knew nothing of that  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be <EOS> <SOS>  kitty then owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us  that in lydia s last letter  she had prepared her for such a step <EOS> <SOS>  she had known  it seems  of their being in love with each other  many weeks <EOS> <SOS>    but not before they went to brighton <EOS> <SOS>    no  i believe not <EOS> <SOS>    and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself <EOS> <SOS>  does he know his real character <EOS> <SOS>    i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did <EOS> <SOS>  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant <EOS> <SOS>  and since this sad affair has taken place  it is said  that he left meryton greatly in debt  but i hope this may be false <EOS> <SOS>    oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of him  this could not have happened <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps it would have been better   replied her sister <EOS> <SOS>   but to expose the former faults of any person  without knowing what their present feelings were  seemed unjustifiable <EOS> <SOS>  we acted with the best intentions <EOS> <SOS>    could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife <EOS> <SOS>    he brought it with him for us to see <EOS> <SOS>   jane then took it from her pocket book  and gave it to elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  these were the contents        my dear harriet        you will laugh when you know where i am gone  and i cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning  as soon as i am      missed <EOS> <SOS>  i am going to gretna green  and if you cannot guess with      who  i shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man in the      world i love  and he is an angel <EOS> <SOS>  i should never be happy without      him  so think it no harm to be off <EOS> <SOS>  you need not send them word at      longbourn of my going  if you do not like it  for it will make the      surprise the greater  when i write to them  and sign my name lydia      wickham <EOS> <SOS>  what a good joke it will be <EOS> <SOS>  i can hardly write for      laughing <EOS> <SOS>  pray make my excuses to pratt  for not keeping my      engagement  and dancing with him to night <EOS> <SOS>  tell him i hope he will      excuse me when he knows all  and tell him i will dance with him at      the next ball we meet  with great pleasure <EOS> <SOS>  i shall send for my      clothes when i get to longbourn  but i wish you would tell sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown  before they are      packed up <EOS> <SOS>  good bye <EOS> <SOS>  give my love to colonel forster  i hope you      will drink to our good journey <EOS> <SOS>        your affectionate friend        lydia bennet <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  thoughtless  thoughtless lydia <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth when she had finished it <EOS> <SOS>   what a letter is this  to be written at such a moment <EOS> <SOS>  but at least it shews  that  she  was serious in the object of her journey <EOS> <SOS>  whatever he might afterwards persuade her to  it was not on her side a  scheme  of infamy <EOS> <SOS>  my poor father <EOS> <SOS>  how he must have felt it <EOS> <SOS>    i never saw any one so shocked <EOS> <SOS>  he could not speak a word for full ten minutes <EOS> <SOS>  my mother was taken ill immediately  and the whole house in such confusion <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  jane   cried elizabeth   was there a servant belonging to it  who did not know the whole story before the end of the day <EOS> <SOS>    i do not know <EOS> <SOS>   i hope there was <EOS> <SOS>   but to be guarded at such a time  is very difficult <EOS> <SOS>  my mother was in hysterics  and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power  i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done <EOS> <SOS>  but the horror of what might possibly happen  almost took from me my faculties <EOS> <SOS>    your attendance upon her  has been too much for you <EOS> <SOS>  you do not look well <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  that i had been with you  you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone <EOS> <SOS>    mary and kitty have been very kind  and would have shared in every fatigue  i am sure  but i did not think it right for either of them <EOS> <SOS>  kitty is slight and delicate  and mary studies so much  that her hours of repose should not be broken in on <EOS> <SOS>  my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday  after my father went away  and was so good as to stay till thursday with me <EOS> <SOS>  she was of great use and comfort to us all  and lady lucas has been very kind  she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us  and offered her services  or any of her daughters  if they could be of use to us <EOS> <SOS>    she had better have stayed at home   cried elizabeth   perhaps she  meant  well  but  under such a misfortune as this  one cannot see too little of one s neighbours <EOS> <SOS>  assistance is impossible  condolence  insufferable <EOS> <SOS>  let them triumph over us at a distance  and be satisfied <EOS> <SOS>   she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his daughter <EOS> <SOS>   he meant  i believe   replied jane   to go to epsom  the place where they last changed horses  see the postilions  and try if any thing could be made out from them <EOS> <SOS>  his principal object must be  to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham <EOS> <SOS>  it had come with a fare from london  and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another  might be remarked  he meant to make enquiries at clapham <EOS> <SOS>  if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare  he determined to make enquiries there  and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach <EOS> <SOS>  i do not know of any other designs that he had formed  but he was in such a hurry to be gone  and his spirits so greatly discomposed  that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this <EOS> <SOS>   chapter vi <EOS> <SOS>  the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line from him <EOS> <SOS>  his family knew him to be on all common occasions  a most negligent and dilatory correspondent  but at such a time  they had hoped for exertion <EOS> <SOS>  they were forced to conclude  that he had no pleasing intelligence to send  but even of  that  they would have been glad to be certain <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off <EOS> <SOS>  when he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on  and their uncle promised  at parting  to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn  as soon as he could  to the great consolation of his sister  who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer  as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces <EOS> <SOS>  she shared in their attendance on mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  and was a great comfort to them  in their hours of freedom <EOS> <SOS>  their other aunt also visited them frequently  and always  as she said  with the design of cheering and heartening them up  though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity  she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them <EOS> <SOS>  all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man  who  but three months before  had been almost an angel of light <EOS> <SOS>  he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues  all honoured with the title of seduction  had been extended into every tradesman s family <EOS> <SOS>  every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world  and every body began to find out  that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  though she did not credit above half of what was said  believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain  and even jane  who believed still less of it  became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come  when if they had gone to scotland  which she had never before entirely despaired of  they must in all probability have gained some news of them <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday  on tuesday  his wife received a letter from him  it told them  that on his arrival  he had immediately found out his brother  and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street <EOS> <SOS>  that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham  before his arrival  but without gaining any satisfactory information  and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town  as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them  on their first coming to london  before they procured lodgings <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it <EOS> <SOS>  he added  that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present  to leave london  and promised to write again very soon <EOS> <SOS>  there was also a postscript to this effect <EOS> <SOS>   i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out  if possible  from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment  whether wickham has any relations or connections  who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself <EOS> <SOS>  if there were any one  that one could apply to  with a probability of gaining such a clue as that  it might be of essential consequence <EOS> <SOS>  at present we have nothing to guide us <EOS> <SOS>  colonel forster will  i dare say  do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head <EOS> <SOS>  but  on second thoughts  perhaps lizzy could tell us  what relations he has now living  better than any other person <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature  as the compliment deserved <EOS> <SOS>  she had never heard of his having had any relations  except a father and mother  both of whom had been dead many years <EOS> <SOS>  it was possible  however  that some of his companions in the     shire  might be able to give more information  and  though she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application was a something to look forward to <EOS> <SOS>  every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected <EOS> <SOS>  the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience <EOS> <SOS>  through letters  whatever of good or bad was to be told  would be communicated  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance <EOS> <SOS>  but before they heard again from mr gardiner  a letter arrived for their father  from a different quarter  from mr collins  which  as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence  she accordingly read  and elizabeth  who knew what curiosities his letters always were  looked over her  and read it likewise <EOS> <SOS>  it was as follows        my dear sir        i feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation      in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from hertfordshire <EOS> <SOS>  be assured  my dear sir  that mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you  and all your respectable      family  in your present distress  which must be of the bitterest      kind  because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove <EOS> <SOS>  no      arguments shall be wanting on my part  that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune  or that may comfort you  under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind <EOS> <SOS>  the death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this <EOS> <SOS>       and it is the more to be lamented  because there is reason to      suppose  as my dear charlotte informs me  that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter  has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence  though  at the same time  for the consolation of      yourself and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  i am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad  or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity  at so early an age <EOS> <SOS>  howsoever that may be  you      are grievously to be pitied  in which opinion i am not only joined      by mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins  but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter       to whom i have related the affair <EOS> <SOS>  they agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter  will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others  for who  as lady      catherine herself condescendingly says  will connect themselves      with such a family <EOS> <SOS>  and this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      november  for had it been otherwise  i must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace <EOS> <SOS>  let me advise you then  my dear sir       to console yourself as much as possible  to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever  and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence <EOS> <SOS>        i am  dear sir   c <EOS> <SOS>   c <EOS> <SOS>   mr gardiner did not write again  till he had received an answer from colonel forster  and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send <EOS> <SOS>  it was not known that wickham had a single relation  with whom he kept up any connection  and it was certain that he had no near one living <EOS> <SOS>  his former acquaintance had been numerous  but since he had been in the militia  it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them <EOS> <SOS>  there was no one therefore who could be pointed out  as likely to give any news of him <EOS> <SOS>  and in the wretched state of his own finances  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy  in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations  for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him  to a very considerable amount <EOS> <SOS>  colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton <EOS> <SOS>  he owed a good deal in the town  but his debts of honour were still more formidable <EOS> <SOS>  mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family  jane heard them with horror <EOS> <SOS>   a gamester <EOS> <SOS>   she cried <EOS> <SOS>   this is wholly unexpected <EOS> <SOS>  i had not an idea of it <EOS> <SOS>   mr gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day  which was saturday <EOS> <SOS>  rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours  he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family  and leave it to him to do  whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit <EOS> <SOS>  when mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was told of this  she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected  considering what her anxiety for his life had been before <EOS> <SOS>   what  is he coming home  and without poor lydia <EOS> <SOS>   she cried <EOS> <SOS>   sure he will not leave london before he has found them <EOS> <SOS>  who is to fight wickham  and make him marry her  if he comes away <EOS> <SOS>   as mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that she and her children should go to london  at the same time that mr bennet came from it <EOS> <SOS>  the coach  therefore  took them the first stage of their journey  and brought its master back to longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend  that had attended her from that part of the world <EOS> <SOS>  his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece  and the kind of half expectation which mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner had formed  of their being followed by a letter from him  had ended in nothing <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had received none since her return  that could come from pemberley <EOS> <SOS>  the present unhappy state of the family  rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  nothing  therefore  could be fairly conjectured from  that   though elizabeth  who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings  was perfectly aware  that  had she known nothing of darcy  she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better <EOS> <SOS>  it would have spared her  she thought  one sleepless night out of two <EOS> <SOS>  when mr bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure <EOS> <SOS>  he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying  made no mention of the business that had taken him away  and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it <EOS> <SOS>  it was not till the afternoon  when he joined them at tea  that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  and then  on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured  he replied   say nothing of that <EOS> <SOS>  who should suffer but myself <EOS> <SOS>  it has been my own doing  and i ought to feel it <EOS> <SOS>    you must not be too severe upon yourself   replied elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   you may well warn me against such an evil <EOS> <SOS>  human nature is so prone to fall into it <EOS> <SOS>  no  lizzy  let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame <EOS> <SOS>  i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression <EOS> <SOS>  it will pass away soon enough <EOS> <SOS>    do you suppose them to be in london <EOS> <SOS>    yes  where else can they be so well concealed <EOS> <SOS>    and lydia used to want to go to london   added kitty <EOS> <SOS>   she is happy  then   said her father  drily   and her residence there will probably be of some duration <EOS> <SOS>   then  after a short silence  he continued   lizzy  i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may  which  considering the event  shews some greatness of mind <EOS> <SOS>   they were interrupted by missennet  who came to fetch her mother s tea <EOS> <SOS>   this is a parade   cried he   which does one good  it gives such an elegance to misfortune <EOS> <SOS>  another day i will do the same  i will sit in my library  in my night cap and powdering gown  and give as much trouble as i can   or  perhaps  i may defer it  till kitty runs away <EOS> <SOS>    i am not going to run away  papa   said kitty  fretfully   if  i  should ever go to brighton  i would behave better than lydia <EOS> <SOS>     you  go to brighton <EOS> <SOS>   i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds <EOS> <SOS>  no  kitty  i have at last learnt to be cautious  and you will feel the effects of it <EOS> <SOS>  no officer is ever to enter my house again  nor even to pass through the village <EOS> <SOS>  balls will be absolutely prohibited  unless you stand up with one of your sisters <EOS> <SOS>  and you are never to stir out of doors  till you can prove  that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner <EOS> <SOS>   kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to cry <EOS> <SOS>   well  well   said he   do not make yourself unhappy <EOS> <SOS>  if you are a good girl for the next ten years  i will take you to a review at the end of them <EOS> <SOS>   chapter vii <EOS> <SOS>  two days after mr bennet s return  as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the housekeeper coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to call them to their mother  went forward to meet her  but  instead of the expected summons  when they approached her  she said to missennet   i beg your pardon  madam  for interrupting you  but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town  so i took the liberty of coming to ask <EOS> <SOS>    what do you mean  hill <EOS> <SOS>  we have heard nothing from town <EOS> <SOS>    dear madam   cried mr <EOS> <SOS>  hill  in great astonishment   don t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner <EOS> <SOS>  he has been here this half hour  and master has had a letter <EOS> <SOS>   away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech <EOS> <SOS>  they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room  from thence to the library   their father was in neither  and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother  when they were met by the butler  who said   if you are looking for my master  ma am  he is walking towards the little copse <EOS> <SOS>   upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall once more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock <EOS> <SOS>  jane  who was not so light  nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for breath  came up with him  and eagerly cried out   oh  papa  what news <EOS> <SOS>  what news <EOS> <SOS>  have you heard from my uncle <EOS> <SOS>    yes  i have had a letter from him by express <EOS> <SOS>    well  and what news does it bring <EOS> <SOS>  good or bad <EOS> <SOS>    what is there of good to be expected <EOS> <SOS>   said he  taking the letter from his pocket   but perhaps you would like to read it <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand <EOS> <SOS>  jane now came up <EOS> <SOS>   read it aloud   said their father   for i hardly know myself what it is about <EOS> <SOS>         gracechurch street  monday       august 2 <EOS> <SOS>        my dear brother        at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece  and such      as  upon the whole  i hope will give you satisfaction <EOS> <SOS>  soon after      you left me on saturday  i was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of london they were <EOS> <SOS>  the particulars  i reserve till we meet <EOS> <SOS>       it is enough to know they are discovered  i have seen them      both       then it is  as i always hoped   cried jane   they are married <EOS> <SOS>        elizabeth read on   i have seen them both <EOS> <SOS>  they are not married       nor can i find there was any intention of being so  but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on      your side  i hope it will not be long before they are <EOS> <SOS>  all that is      required of you is  to assure to your daughter  by settlement  her      equal share of the five thousand pounds  secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister  and       moreover  to enter into an engagement of allowing her  during your      life  one hundred pounds per annum <EOS> <SOS>  these are conditions  which       considering every thing  i had no hesitation in complying with  as      far as i thought myself privileged  for you <EOS> <SOS>  i shall send this by      express  that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer <EOS> <SOS>  you      will easily comprehend  from these particulars  that mr wickham s      circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to      be <EOS> <SOS>  the world has been deceived in that respect  and i am happy to      say  there will be some little money  even when all his debts are      discharged  to settle on my niece  in addition to her own fortune <EOS> <SOS>       if  as i conclude will be the case  you send me full powers to act      in your name  throughout the whole of this business  i will      immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement <EOS> <SOS>  there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again  therefore  stay quietly at longbourn  and depend on      my diligence and care <EOS> <SOS>  send back your answer as soon as you can       and be careful to write explicitly <EOS> <SOS>  we have judged it best  that my      niece should be married from this house  of which i hope you will      approve <EOS> <SOS>  she comes to us to day <EOS> <SOS>  i shall write again as soon as any      thing more is determined on <EOS> <SOS>  your s   c <EOS> <SOS>        edw <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner <EOS> <SOS>    is it possible <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth  when she had finished <EOS> <SOS>   can it be possible that he will marry her <EOS> <SOS>    wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we have thought him   said her sister <EOS> <SOS>   my dear father  i congratulate you <EOS> <SOS>    and have you answered the letter <EOS> <SOS>   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   no  but it must be done soon <EOS> <SOS>   most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear father   she cried   come back  and write immediately <EOS> <SOS>  consider how important every moment is  in such a case <EOS> <SOS>    let me write for you   said jane   if you dislike the trouble yourself <EOS> <SOS>    i dislike it very much   he replied   but it must be done <EOS> <SOS>   and so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the house <EOS> <SOS>   and may i ask <EOS> <SOS>   said elizabeth   but the terms  i suppose  must be complied with <EOS> <SOS>    complied with <EOS> <SOS>  i am only ashamed of his asking so little <EOS> <SOS>    and they  must  marry <EOS> <SOS>  yet he is  such  a man <EOS> <SOS>    yes  yes  they must marry <EOS> <SOS>  there is nothing else to be done <EOS> <SOS>  but there are two things that i want very much to know   one is  how much money your uncle has laid down  to bring it about  and the other  how i am ever to pay him <EOS> <SOS>    money <EOS> <SOS>  my uncle <EOS> <SOS>   cried jane   what do you mean  sir <EOS> <SOS>    i mean  that no man in his senses  would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty after i am gone <EOS> <SOS>    that is very true   said elizabeth   though it had not occurred to me before <EOS> <SOS>  his debts to be discharged  and something still to remain <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  it must be my uncle s doings <EOS> <SOS>  generous  good man  i am afraid he has distressed himself <EOS> <SOS>  a small sum could not do all this <EOS> <SOS>    no   said her father   wickham s a fool  if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>  i should be sorry to think so ill of him  in the very beginning of our relationship <EOS> <SOS>    ten thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>  heaven forbid <EOS> <SOS>  how is half such a sum to be repaid <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet made no answer  and each of them  deep in thought  continued silent till they reached the house <EOS> <SOS>  their father then went to the library to write  and the girls walked into the breakfast room <EOS> <SOS>   and they are really to be married <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth  as soon as they were by themselves <EOS> <SOS>   how strange this is <EOS> <SOS>  and for  this  we are to be thankful <EOS> <SOS>  that they should marry  small as is their chance of happiness  and wretched as is his character  we are forced to rejoice <EOS> <SOS>  oh  lydia <EOS> <SOS>    i comfort myself with thinking   replied jane   that he certainly would not marry lydia  if he had not a real regard for her <EOS> <SOS>  though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him  i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds  or any thing like it  has been advanced <EOS> <SOS>  he has children of his own  and may have more <EOS> <SOS>  how could he spare half ten thousand pounds <EOS> <SOS>    if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been   said elizabeth   and how much is settled on his side on our sister  we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them  because wickham has not sixpence of his own <EOS> <SOS>  the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited <EOS> <SOS>  their taking her home  and affording her their personal protection and countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage  as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge <EOS> <SOS>  by this time she is actually with them <EOS> <SOS>  if such goodness does not make her miserable now  she will never deserve to be happy <EOS> <SOS>  what a meeting for her  when she first sees my aunt <EOS> <SOS>    we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side   said jane   i hope and trust they will yet be happy <EOS> <SOS>  his consenting to marry her is a proof  i will believe  that he is come to a right way of thinking <EOS> <SOS>  their mutual affection will steady them  and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly  and live in so rational a manner  as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten <EOS> <SOS>    their conduct has been such   replied elizabeth   as neither you  nor i  nor any body  can ever forget <EOS> <SOS>  it is useless to talk of it <EOS> <SOS>   it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened <EOS> <SOS>  they went to the library  therefore  and asked their father  whether he would not wish them to make it known to her <EOS> <SOS>  he was writing  and  without raising his head  coolly replied   just as you please <EOS> <SOS>    may we take my uncle s letter to read to her <EOS> <SOS>    take whatever you like  and get away <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth took the letter from his writing table  and they went up stairs together <EOS> <SOS>  mary and kitty were both with mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  one communication would  therefore  do for all <EOS> <SOS>  after a slight preparation for good news  the letter was read aloud <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet could hardly contain herself <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as jane had read mr gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married  her joy burst forth  and every following sentence added to its exuberance <EOS> <SOS>  she was now in an irritation as violent from delight  as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation <EOS> <SOS>  to know that her daughter would be married was enough <EOS> <SOS>  she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct <EOS> <SOS>   my dear  dear lydia <EOS> <SOS>   she cried   this is delightful indeed <EOS> <SOS>   she will be married <EOS> <SOS>   i shall see her again <EOS> <SOS>   she will be married at sixteen <EOS> <SOS>   my good  kind brother <EOS> <SOS>   i knew how it would be  i knew he would manage every thing <EOS> <SOS>  how i long to see her <EOS> <SOS>  and to see dear wickham too <EOS> <SOS>  but the clothes  the wedding clothes <EOS> <SOS>  i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly <EOS> <SOS>  lizzy  my dear  run down to your father  and ask him how much he will give her <EOS> <SOS>  stay  stay  i will go myself <EOS> <SOS>  ring the bell  kitty  for hill <EOS> <SOS>  i will put on my things in a moment <EOS> <SOS>  my dear  dear lydia <EOS> <SOS>   how merry we shall be together when we meet <EOS> <SOS>   her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports  by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner s behaviour laid them all under <EOS> <SOS>   for we must attribute this happy conclusion   she added   in a great measure  to his kindness <EOS> <SOS>  we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money <EOS> <SOS>    well   cried her mother   it is all very right  who should do it but her own uncle <EOS> <SOS>  if he had not had a family of his own  i and my children must have had all his money you know  and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him  except a few presents <EOS> <SOS>  well <EOS> <SOS>  i am so happy <EOS> <SOS>  in a short time  i shall have a daughter married <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  wickham <EOS> <SOS>  how well it sounds <EOS> <SOS>  and she was only sixteen last june <EOS> <SOS>  my dear jane  i am in such a flutter  that i am sure i can t write  so i will dictate  and you write for me <EOS> <SOS>  we will settle with your father about the money afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately <EOS> <SOS>   she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico  muslin  and cambric  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders  had not jane  though with some difficulty  persuaded her to wait  till her father was at leisure to be consulted <EOS> <SOS>  one day s delay she observed  would be of small importance  and her mother was too happy  to be quite so obstinate as usual <EOS> <SOS>  other schemes too came into her head <EOS> <SOS>   i will go to meryton   said she   as soon as i am dressed  and tell the good  good news to my sister philips <EOS> <SOS>  and as i come back  i can call on lady lucas and mr <EOS> <SOS>  long <EOS> <SOS>  kitty  run down and order the carriage <EOS> <SOS>  an airing would do me a great deal of good  i am sure <EOS> <SOS>  girls  can i do any thing for you in meryton <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  here comes hill <EOS> <SOS>  my dear hill  have you heard the good news <EOS> <SOS>  missydia is going to be married  and you shall all have a bowl of punch  to make merry at her wedding <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  hill began instantly to express her joy <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this folly  took refuge in her own room  that she might think with freedom <EOS> <SOS>  poor lydia s situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it was no worse  she had need to be thankful <EOS> <SOS>  she felt it so  and though  in looking forward  neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity  could be justly expected for her sister  in looking back to what they had feared  only two hours ago  she felt all the advantages of what they had gained <EOS> <SOS>  chapter viii <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet had very often wished  before this period of his life  that  instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an annual sum  for the better provision of his children  and of his wife  if she survived him <EOS> <SOS>  he now wished it more than ever <EOS> <SOS>  had he done his duty in that respect  lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle  for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her <EOS> <SOS>  the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband  might then have rested in its proper place <EOS> <SOS>  he was seriously concerned  that a cause of so little advantage to any one  should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law  and he was determined  if possible  to find out the extent of his assistance  and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could <EOS> <SOS>  when first mr bennet had married  economy was held to be perfectly useless  for  of course  they were to have a son <EOS> <SOS>  this son was to join in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should be of age  and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for <EOS> <SOS>  five daughters successively entered the world  but yet the son was to come  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  for many years after lydia s birth  had been certain that he would <EOS> <SOS>  this event had at last been despaired of  but it was then too late to be saving <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had no turn for economy  and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income <EOS> <SOS>  five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and the children <EOS> <SOS>  but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter  depended on the will of the parents <EOS> <SOS>  this was one point  with regard to lydia at least  which was now to be settled  and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him <EOS> <SOS>  in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother  though expressed most concisely  he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done  and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him <EOS> <SOS>  he had never before supposed that  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter  it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself  as by the present arrangement <EOS> <SOS>  he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser  by the hundred that was to be paid them  for  what with her board and pocket allowance  and the continual presents in money  which passed to her  through her mother s hands  lydia s expences had been very little within that sum <EOS> <SOS>  that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side  too  was another very welcome surprise  for his chief wish at present  was to have as little trouble in the business as possible <EOS> <SOS>  when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over  he naturally returned to all his former indolence <EOS> <SOS>  his letter was soon dispatched  for though dilatory in undertaking business  he was quick in its execution <EOS> <SOS>  he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother  but was too angry with lydia  to send any message to her <EOS> <SOS>  the good news quickly spread through the house  and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood <EOS> <SOS>  it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy <EOS> <SOS>  to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation  had missydia bennet come upon the town  or  as the happiest alternative  been secluded from the world  in some distant farm house <EOS> <SOS>  but there was much to be talked of  in marrying her  and the good natured wishes for her well doing  which had proceeded before  from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton  lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances  because with such an husband  her misery was considered certain <EOS> <SOS>  it was a fortnight since mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had been down stairs  but on this happy day  she again took her seat at the head of her table  and in spirits oppressively high <EOS> <SOS>  no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph <EOS> <SOS>  the marriage of a daughter  which had been the first object of her wishes  since jane was sixteen  was now on the point of accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new carriages  and servants <EOS> <SOS>  she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter  and  without knowing or considering what their income might be  rejected many as deficient in size and importance <EOS> <SOS>   haye park might do   said she   if the gouldings would quit it  or the great house at stoke  if the drawing room were larger  but ashworth is too far off <EOS> <SOS>  i could not bear to have her ten miles from me  and as for purvis lodge  the attics are dreadful <EOS> <SOS>   her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption  while the servants remained <EOS> <SOS>  but when they had withdrawn  he said to her   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  before you take any  or all of these houses  for your son and daughter  let us come to a right understanding <EOS> <SOS>  into  one  house in this neighbourhood  they shall never have admittance <EOS> <SOS>  i will not encourage the impudence of either  by receiving them at longbourn <EOS> <SOS>   a long dispute followed this declaration  but mr bennet was firm  it soon led to another  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet found  with amazement and horror  that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter <EOS> <SOS>  he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever  on the occasion <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet could hardly comprehend it <EOS> <SOS>  that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment  as to refuse his daughter a privilege  without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid  exceeded all that she could believe possible <EOS> <SOS>  she was more alive to the disgrace  which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials  than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham  a fortnight before they took place <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the distress of the moment  been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister  for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement  they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning  from all those who were not immediately on the spot <EOS> <SOS>  she had no fear of its spreading farther  through his means <EOS> <SOS>  there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended  but at the same time  there was no one  whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much <EOS> <SOS>  not  however  from any fear of disadvantage from it  individually to herself  for at any rate  there seemed a gulf impassable between them <EOS> <SOS>  had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms  it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family  where to every other objection would now be added  an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned <EOS> <SOS>  from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink <EOS> <SOS>  the wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire  could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this <EOS> <SOS>  she was humbled  she was grieved  she repented  though she hardly knew of what <EOS> <SOS>  she became jealous of his esteem  when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it <EOS> <SOS>  she wanted to hear of him  when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence <EOS> <SOS>  she was convinced that she could have been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they should meet <EOS> <SOS>  what a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago  would now have been gladly and gratefully received <EOS> <SOS>  he was as generous  she doubted not  as the most generous of his sex <EOS> <SOS>  but while he was mortal  there must be a triumph <EOS> <SOS>  she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man  who  in disposition and talents  would most suit her <EOS> <SOS>  his understanding and temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her wishes <EOS> <SOS>  it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both  by her ease and liveliness  his mind might have been softened  his manners improved  and from his judgment  information  and knowledge of the world  she must have received benefit of greater importance <EOS> <SOS>  but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was <EOS> <SOS>  an union of a different tendency  and precluding the possibility of the other  was soon to be formed in their family <EOS> <SOS>  how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence  she could not imagine <EOS> <SOS>  but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue  she could easily conjecture <EOS> <SOS>                                           mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother <EOS> <SOS>  to mr bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family  and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again <EOS> <SOS>  the principal purport of his letter was to inform them  that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia <EOS> <SOS>        it was greatly my wish that he should do so   he added   as soon      as his marriage was fixed on <EOS> <SOS>  and i think you will agree with me       in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable  both      on his account and my niece s <EOS> <SOS>  it is mr wickham s intention to go      into the regulars  and  among his former friends  there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army <EOS> <SOS>  he has the      promise of an ensigncy in general      s regiment  now quartered in      the north <EOS> <SOS>  it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom <EOS> <SOS>  he promises fairly  and i hope among different people       where they may each have a character to preserve  they will both be      more prudent <EOS> <SOS>  i have written to colonel forster  to inform him of      our present arrangements  and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton  with      assurances of speedy payment  for which i have pledged myself <EOS> <SOS>  and      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in meryton  of whom i shall subjoin a list       according to his information <EOS> <SOS>  he has given in all his debts  i hope      at least he has not deceived us <EOS> <SOS>  haggerston has our directions  and      all will be completed in a week <EOS> <SOS>  they will then join his regiment       unless they are first invited to longbourn  and i understand from      mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all       before she leaves the south <EOS> <SOS>  she is well  and begs to be dutifully      remembered to you and her mother <EOS> <SOS>   your s   c <EOS> <SOS>        e <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner <EOS> <SOS>   mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the     shire  as clearly as mr gardiner could do <EOS> <SOS>  but mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  was not so well pleased with it <EOS> <SOS>  lydia s being settled in the north  just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company  for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire  was a severe disappointment  and besides  it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body  and had so many favourites <EOS> <SOS>   she is so fond of mr <EOS> <SOS>  forster   said she   it will be quite shocking to send her away <EOS> <SOS>  and there are several of the young men  too  that she likes very much <EOS> <SOS>  the officers may not be so pleasant in general      s regiment <EOS> <SOS>   his daughter s request  for such it might be considered  of being admitted into her family again  before she set off for the north  received at first an absolute negative <EOS> <SOS>  but jane and elizabeth  who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents  urged him so earnestly  yet so rationally and so mildly  to receive her and her husband at longbourn  as soon as they were married  that he was prevailed on to think as they thought  and act as they wished <EOS> <SOS>  and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing  that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood  before she was banished to the north <EOS> <SOS>  when mr bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore  he sent his permission for them to come  and it was settled  that as soon as the ceremony was over  they should proceed to longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was surprised  however  that wickham should consent to such a scheme  and  had she consulted only her own inclination  any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes <EOS> <SOS>  chapter ix <EOS> <SOS>  their sister s wedding day arrived  and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself <EOS> <SOS>  the carriage was sent to meet them at       and they were to return in it  by dinner time <EOS> <SOS>  their arrival was dreaded by the elder missennets  and jane more especially  who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself  had  she  been the culprit  was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure <EOS> <SOS>  they came <EOS> <SOS>  the family were assembled in the breakfast room  to receive them <EOS> <SOS>  smiles decked the face of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  as the carriage drove up to the door  her husband looked impenetrably grave  her daughters  alarmed  anxious  uneasy <EOS> <SOS>  lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown open  and she ran into the room <EOS> <SOS>  her mother stepped forwards  embraced her  and welcomed her with rapture  gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham  who followed his lady  and wished them both joy  with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness <EOS> <SOS>  their reception from mr bennet  to whom they then turned  was not quite so cordial <EOS> <SOS>  his countenance rather gained in austerity  and he scarcely opened his lips <EOS> <SOS>  the easy assurance of the young couple  indeed  was enough to provoke him <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was disgusted  and even missennet was shocked <EOS> <SOS>  lydia was lydia still  untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy  and fearless <EOS> <SOS>  she turned from sister to sister  demanding their congratulations  and when at length they all sat down  looked eagerly round the room  took notice of some little alteration in it  and observed  with a laugh  that it was a great while since she had been there <EOS> <SOS>  wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his manners were always so pleasing  that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy address  while he claimed their relationship  would have delighted them all <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance  but she sat down  resolving within herself  to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man <EOS> <SOS>   she  blushed  and jane blushed  but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion  suffered no variation of colour <EOS> <SOS>  there was no want of discourse <EOS> <SOS>  the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough  and wickham  who happened to sit near elizabeth  began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood  with a good humoured ease  which she felt very unable to equal in her replies <EOS> <SOS>  they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world <EOS> <SOS>  nothing of the past was recollected with pain  and lydia led voluntarily to subjects  which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world <EOS> <SOS>   only think of its being three months   she cried   since i went away  it seems but a fortnight i declare  and yet there have been things enough happened in the time <EOS> <SOS>  good gracious <EOS> <SOS>  when i went away  i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again <EOS> <SOS>  though i thought it would be very good fun if i was <EOS> <SOS>   her father lifted up his eyes <EOS> <SOS>  jane was distressed <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth looked expressively at lydia  but she  who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued   oh <EOS> <SOS>  mamma  do the people here abouts know i am married to day <EOS> <SOS>  i was afraid they might not  and we overtook william goulding in his curricle  so i was determined he should know it  and so i let down the side glass next to him  and took off my glove  and let my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that he might see the ring  and then i bowed and smiled like any thing <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could bear it no longer <EOS> <SOS>  she got up  and ran out of the room  and returned no more  till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour <EOS> <SOS>  she then joined them soon enough to see lydia  with anxious parade  walk up to her mother s right hand  and hear her say to her eldest sister   ah <EOS> <SOS>  jane  i take your place now  and you must go lower  because i am a married woman <EOS> <SOS>   it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment  from which she had been so wholly free at first <EOS> <SOS>  her ease and good spirits increased <EOS> <SOS>  she longed to see mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  the lucases  and all their other neighbours  and to hear herself called  mr <EOS> <SOS>  wickham   by each of them  and in the mean time  she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married  to mr <EOS> <SOS>  hill and the two housemaids <EOS> <SOS>   well  mamma   said she  when they were all returned to the breakfast room   and what do you think of my husband <EOS> <SOS>  is not he a charming man <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure my sisters must all envy me <EOS> <SOS>  i only hope they may have half my good luck <EOS> <SOS>  they must all go to brighton <EOS> <SOS>  that is the place to get husbands <EOS> <SOS>  what a pity it is  mamma  we did not all go <EOS> <SOS>    very true  and if i had my will  we should <EOS> <SOS>  but my dear lydia  i don t at all like your going such a way off <EOS> <SOS>  must it be so <EOS> <SOS>    oh  lord <EOS> <SOS>  yes   there is nothing in that <EOS> <SOS>  i shall like it of all things <EOS> <SOS>  you and papa  and my sisters  must come down and see us <EOS> <SOS>  we shall be at newcastle all the winter  and i dare say there will be some balls  and i will take care to get good partners for them all <EOS> <SOS>    i should like it beyond any thing <EOS> <SOS>   said her mother <EOS> <SOS>   and then when you go away  you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over <EOS> <SOS>    i thank you for my share of the favour   said elizabeth   but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands <EOS> <SOS>   their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham had received his commission before he left london  and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight <EOS> <SOS>  no one but mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  regretted that their stay would be so short  and she made the most of the time  by visiting about with her daughter  and having very frequent parties at home <EOS> <SOS>  these parties were acceptable to all  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think  than such as did not <EOS> <SOS>  wickham s affection for lydia  was just what elizabeth had expected to find it  not equal to lydia s for him <EOS> <SOS>  she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied  from the reason of things  that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love  rather than by his  and she would have wondered why  without violently caring for her  he chose to elope with her at all  had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and if that were the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion <EOS> <SOS>  lydia was exceedingly fond of him <EOS> <SOS>  he was her dear wickham on every occasion  no one was to be put in competition with him <EOS> <SOS>  he did every thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september  than any body else in the country <EOS> <SOS>  one morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with her two elder sisters  she said to elizabeth   lizzy  i never gave  you  an account of my wedding  i believe <EOS> <SOS>  you were not by  when i told mamma  and the others  all about it <EOS> <SOS>  are not you curious to hear how it was managed <EOS> <SOS>    no really   replied elizabeth   i think there cannot be too little said on the subject <EOS> <SOS>    la <EOS> <SOS>  you are so strange <EOS> <SOS>  but i must tell you how it went off <EOS> <SOS>  we were married  you know  at st <EOS> <SOS>  clement s  because wickham s lodgings were in that parish <EOS> <SOS>  and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock <EOS> <SOS>  my uncle and aunt and i were to go together  and the others were to meet us at the church <EOS> <SOS>  well  monday morning came  and i was in such a fuss <EOS> <SOS>  i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off  and then i should have gone quite distracted <EOS> <SOS>  and there was my aunt  all the time i was dressing  preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon <EOS> <SOS>  however  i did not hear above one word in ten  for i was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear wickham <EOS> <SOS>  i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat <EOS> <SOS>   well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  i thought it would never be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them <EOS> <SOS>  if you ll believe me  i did not once put my foot out of doors  though i was there a fortnight <EOS> <SOS>  not one party  or scheme  or any thing <EOS> <SOS>  to be sure london was rather thin  but however the little theatre was open <EOS> <SOS>  well  and so just as the carriage came to the door  my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone <EOS> <SOS>  and then  you know  when once they get together  there is no end of it <EOS> <SOS>  well  i was so frightened i did not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day <EOS> <SOS>  but  luckily  he came back again in ten minutes time  and then we all set out <EOS> <SOS>  however  i recollected afterwards  that if he  had  been prevented going  the wedding need not be put off  for mr darcy might have done as well <EOS> <SOS>    mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   repeated elizabeth  in utter amazement <EOS> <SOS>   oh  yes <EOS> <SOS>   he was to come there with wickham  you know <EOS> <SOS>  but gracious me <EOS> <SOS>  i quite forgot <EOS> <SOS>  i ought not to have said a word about it <EOS> <SOS>  i promised them so faithfully <EOS> <SOS>  what will wickham say <EOS> <SOS>  it was to be such a secret <EOS> <SOS>    if it was to be secret   said jane   say not another word on the subject <EOS> <SOS>  you may depend upon my seeking no further <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  certainly   said elizabeth  though burning with curiosity   we will ask you no questions <EOS> <SOS>    thank you   said lydia   for if you did  i should certainly tell you all  and then wickham would be angry <EOS> <SOS>   on such encouragement to ask  elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power  by running away <EOS> <SOS>  but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at least it was impossible not to try for information <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy had been at her sister s wedding <EOS> <SOS>  it was exactly a scene  and exactly among people  where he had apparently least to do  and least temptation to go <EOS> <SOS>  conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and wild  hurried into her brain  but she was satisfied with none <EOS> <SOS>  those that best pleased her  as placing his conduct in the noblest light  seemed most improbable <EOS> <SOS>  she could not bear such suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  wrote a short letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended <EOS> <SOS>   you may readily comprehend   she added   what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and  comparatively speaking  a stranger to our family  should have been amongst you at such a time <EOS> <SOS>  pray write instantly  and let me understand it  unless it is  for very cogent reasons  to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary  and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance <EOS> <SOS>    not that i  shall  though   she added to herself  as she finished the letter   and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in an honourable manner  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out <EOS> <SOS>   jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  elizabeth was glad of it   till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante <EOS> <SOS>  chapter x <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter  as soon as she possibly could <EOS> <SOS>  she was no sooner in possession of it  than hurrying into the little copse  where she was least likely to be interrupted  she sat down on one of the benches  and prepared to be happy  for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial <EOS> <SOS>        gracechurch street  sept <EOS> <SOS>  6 <EOS> <SOS>        my dear niece        i have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it  as i foresee that a  little  writing will      not comprise what i have to tell you <EOS> <SOS>  i must confess myself      surprised by your application  i did not expect it from  you  <EOS> <SOS>       don t think me angry  however  for i only mean to let you know       that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your       side <EOS> <SOS>  if you do not choose to understand me  forgive my      impertinence <EOS> <SOS>  your uncle is as much surprised as i am  and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned  would have allowed      him to act as he has done <EOS> <SOS>  but if you are really innocent and      ignorant  i must be more explicit <EOS> <SOS>  on the very day of my coming      home from longbourn  your uncle had a most unexpected visitor <EOS> <SOS>  mr      darcy called  and was shut up with him several hours <EOS> <SOS>  it was all      over before i arrived  so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as  your s  seems to have been <EOS> <SOS>  he came to tell mr gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were  and that      he had seen and talked with them both  wickham repeatedly  lydia      once <EOS> <SOS>  from what i can collect  he left derbyshire only one day      after ourselves  and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them <EOS> <SOS>  the motive professed  was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well      known  as to make it impossible for any young woman of character       to love or confide in him <EOS> <SOS>  he generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride  and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him  to lay his private actions open to the world <EOS> <SOS>  his character      was to speak for itself <EOS> <SOS>  he called it  therefore  his duty to step      forward  and endeavour to remedy an evil  which had been brought on      by himself <EOS> <SOS>  if he  had another  motive  i am sure it would never      disgrace him <EOS> <SOS>  he had been some days in town  before he was able to      discover them  but he had something to direct his search  which was      more than  we  had  and the consciousness of this  was another      reason for his resolving to follow us <EOS> <SOS>  there is a lady  it seems  a      mr <EOS> <SOS>  younge  who was some time ago governess to missarcy  and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation  though      he did not say what <EOS> <SOS>  she then took a large house in edward street       and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings <EOS> <SOS>  this mr <EOS> <SOS>       younge was  he knew  intimately acquainted with wickham  and he      went to her for intelligence of him  as soon as he got to town <EOS> <SOS>  but      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted <EOS> <SOS>  she would not betray her trust  i suppose  without bribery      and corruption  for she really did know where her friend was to be      found <EOS> <SOS>  wickham indeed had gone to her  on their first arrival in      london  and had she been able to receive them into her house  they      would have taken up their abode with her <EOS> <SOS>  at length  however  our      kind friend procured the wished for direction <EOS> <SOS>  they were in           street <EOS> <SOS>  he saw wickham  and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia <EOS> <SOS>       his first object with her  he acknowledged  had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation  and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her       offering his assistance  as far as it would go <EOS> <SOS>  but he found lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was <EOS> <SOS>  she cared for none      of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not hear of      leaving wickham <EOS> <SOS>  she was sure they should be married some time or      other  and it did not much signify when <EOS> <SOS>  since such were her      feelings  it only remained  he thought  to secure and expedite a      marriage  which  in his very first conversation with wickham  he      easily learnt  had never been  his  design <EOS> <SOS>  he confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment  on account of some debts of honour       which were very pressing  and scrupled not to lay all the      ill consequences of lydia s flight  on her own folly alone <EOS> <SOS>  he      meant to resign his commission immediately  and as to his future      situation  he could conjecture very little about it <EOS> <SOS>  he must go      somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew he should have      nothing to live on <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once <EOS> <SOS>  though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich       he would have been able to do something for him  and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage <EOS> <SOS>  but he found  in reply to      this question  that wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage  in some other country <EOS> <SOS>       under such circumstances  however  he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief <EOS> <SOS>  they met several times       for there was much to be discussed <EOS> <SOS>  wickham of course wanted more      than he could get  but at length was reduced to be reasonable <EOS> <SOS>       every thing being settled between  them   mr darcy s next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in      gracechurch street the evening before i came home <EOS> <SOS>  but mr gardiner      could not be seen  and mr darcy found  on further enquiry  that      your father was still with him  but would quit town the next      morning <EOS> <SOS>  he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle  and therefore readily postponed      seeing him  till after the departure of the former <EOS> <SOS>  he did not      leave his name  and till the next day  it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business <EOS> <SOS>  on saturday he came again <EOS> <SOS>  your      father was gone  your uncle at home  and  as i said before  they      had a great deal of talk together <EOS> <SOS>  they met again on sunday  and      then  i  saw him too <EOS> <SOS>  it was not all settled before monday  as soon      as it was  the express was sent off to longbourn <EOS> <SOS>  but our visitor      was very obstinate <EOS> <SOS>  i fancy  lizzy  that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all <EOS> <SOS>  he has been accused of many      faults at different times  but  this  is the true one <EOS> <SOS>  nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself  though i am sure  and i do      not speak it to be thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole <EOS> <SOS>  they battled it      together for a long time  which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved <EOS> <SOS>  but at last your uncle was forced      to yield  and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece       was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it       which went sorely against the grain  and i really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure  because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers  and give      the praise where it was due <EOS> <SOS>  but  lizzy  this must go no farther      than yourself  or jane at most <EOS> <SOS>  you know pretty well  i suppose       what has been done for the young people <EOS> <SOS>  his debts are to be paid       amounting  i believe  to considerably more than a thousand pounds       another thousand in addition to her own settled upon  her   and his      commission purchased <EOS> <SOS>  the reason why all this was to be done by him      alone  was such as i have given above <EOS> <SOS>  it was owing to him  to his      reserve  and want of proper consideration  that wickham s character      had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps there was some truth in       this   though i doubt whether  his  reserve  or  anybody s       reserve  can be answerable for the event <EOS> <SOS>  but in spite of all this      fine talking  my dear lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured  that      your uncle would never have yielded  if we had not given him credit      for  another interest  in the affair <EOS> <SOS>  when all this was resolved      on  he returned again to his friends  who were still staying at      pemberley  but it was agreed that he should be in london once more      when the wedding took place  and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish <EOS> <SOS>  i believe i have now told you every thing <EOS> <SOS>       it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise  i      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure <EOS> <SOS>  lydia came to      us  and wickham had constant admission to the house <EOS> <SOS>   he  was      exactly what he had been  when i knew him in hertfordshire  but i      would not tell you how little i was satisfied with  her  behaviour      while she staid with us  if i had not perceived  by jane s letter      last wednesday  that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it  and therefore what i now tell you  can give you no      fresh pain <EOS> <SOS>  i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner       representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done  and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family <EOS> <SOS>  if she heard me       it was by good luck  for i am sure she did not listen <EOS> <SOS>  i was      sometimes quite provoked  but then i recollected my dear elizabeth      and jane  and for their sakes had patience with her <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy was      punctual in his return  and as lydia informed you  attended the      wedding <EOS> <SOS>  he dined with us the next day  and was to leave town again      on wednesday or thursday <EOS> <SOS>  will you be very angry with me  my dear      lizzy  if i take this opportunity of saying  what i was never bold      enough to say before  how much i like him <EOS> <SOS>  his behaviour to us has       in every respect  been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire <EOS> <SOS>       his understanding and opinions all please me  he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness  and  that   if he marry  prudently   his      wife may teach him <EOS> <SOS>  i thought him very sly   he hardly ever      mentioned your name <EOS> <SOS>  but slyness seems the fashion <EOS> <SOS>  pray forgive      me  if i have been very presuming  or at least do not punish me so      far  as to exclude me from p <EOS> <SOS>  i shall never be quite happy till i      have been all round the park <EOS> <SOS>  a low phaeton  with a nice little      pair of ponies  would be the very thing <EOS> <SOS>  but i must write no more <EOS> <SOS>       the children have been wanting me this half hour <EOS> <SOS>  your s  very      sincerely        m <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner <EOS> <SOS>   the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share <EOS> <SOS>  the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match  which she had feared to encourage  as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the pain of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true <EOS> <SOS>  he had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research  in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise  and where he was reduced to meet  frequently meet  reason with  persuade  and finally bribe  the man whom he always most wished to avoid  and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce <EOS> <SOS>  he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem <EOS> <SOS>  her heart did whisper  that he had done it for her <EOS> <SOS>  but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection for her  for a woman who had already refused him  as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham <EOS> <SOS>  brother in law of wickham <EOS> <SOS>  every kind of pride must revolt from the connection <EOS> <SOS>  he had to be sure done much <EOS> <SOS>  she was ashamed to think how much <EOS> <SOS>  but he had given a reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief <EOS> <SOS>  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it  and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement  she could  perhaps  believe  that remaining partiality for her  might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned <EOS> <SOS>  it was painful  exceedingly painful  to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return <EOS> <SOS>  they owed the restoration of lydia  her character  every thing to him <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged  every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him <EOS> <SOS>  for herself she was humbled  but she was proud of him <EOS> <SOS>  proud that in a cause of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of himself <EOS> <SOS>  she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again <EOS> <SOS>  it was hardly enough  but it pleased her <EOS> <SOS>  she was even sensible of some pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself <EOS> <SOS>  she was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one s approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was overtaken by wickham <EOS> <SOS>   i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister <EOS> <SOS>   said he  as he joined her <EOS> <SOS>   you certainly do   she replied with a smile   but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome <EOS> <SOS>    i should be sorry indeed  if it were <EOS> <SOS>   we  were always good friends  and now we are better <EOS> <SOS>    true <EOS> <SOS>  are the others coming out <EOS> <SOS>    i do not know <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton <EOS> <SOS>  and so  my dear sister  i find from our uncle and aunt  that you have actually seen pemberley <EOS> <SOS>   she replied in the affirmative <EOS> <SOS>   i almost envy you the pleasure  and yet i believe it would be too much for me  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle <EOS> <SOS>  and you saw the old housekeeper  i suppose <EOS> <SOS>  poor reynolds  she was always very fond of me <EOS> <SOS>  but of course she did not mention my name to you <EOS> <SOS>    yes  she did <EOS> <SOS>    and what did she say <EOS> <SOS>    that you were gone into the army  and she was afraid had  not turned out well <EOS> <SOS>  at such a distance as  that   you know  things are strangely misrepresented <EOS> <SOS>    certainly   he replied  biting his lips <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth hoped she had silenced him  but he soon afterwards said   i was surprised to see darcy in town last month <EOS> <SOS>  we passed each other several times <EOS> <SOS>  i wonder what he can be doing there <EOS> <SOS>    perhaps preparing for his marriage with misse bourgh   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   it must be something particular  to take him there at this time of year <EOS> <SOS>    undoubtedly <EOS> <SOS>  did you see him while you were at lambton <EOS> <SOS>  i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had <EOS> <SOS>    yes  he introduced us to his sister <EOS> <SOS>    and do you like her <EOS> <SOS>    very much <EOS> <SOS>    i have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two <EOS> <SOS>  when i last saw her  she was not very promising <EOS> <SOS>  i am very glad you liked her <EOS> <SOS>  i hope she will turn out well <EOS> <SOS>    i dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age <EOS> <SOS>    did you go by the village of kympton <EOS> <SOS>    i do not recollect that we did <EOS> <SOS>    i mention it  because it is the living which i ought to have had <EOS> <SOS>  a most delightful place <EOS> <SOS>   excellent parsonage house <EOS> <SOS>  it would have suited me in every respect <EOS> <SOS>    how should you have liked making sermons <EOS> <SOS>    exceedingly well <EOS> <SOS>  i should have considered it as part of my duty  and the exertion would soon have been nothing <EOS> <SOS>  one ought not to repine   but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing for me <EOS> <SOS>  the quiet  the retirement of such a life  would have answered all my ideas of happiness <EOS> <SOS>  but it was not to be <EOS> <SOS>  did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance  when you were in kent <EOS> <SOS>    i  have  heard from authority  which i thought  as good   that it was left you conditionally only  and at the will of the present patron <EOS> <SOS>    you have <EOS> <SOS>  yes  there was something in  that   i told you so from the first  you may remember <EOS> <SOS>    i  did  hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders  and that the business had been compromised accordingly <EOS> <SOS>    you did <EOS> <SOS>  and it was not wholly without foundation <EOS> <SOS>  you may remember what i told you on that point  when first we talked of it <EOS> <SOS>   they were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked fast to get rid of him  and unwilling for her sister s sake  to provoke him  she only said in reply  with a good humoured smile   come  mr wickham  we are brother and sister  you know <EOS> <SOS>  do not let us quarrel about the past <EOS> <SOS>  in future  i hope we shall be always of one mind <EOS> <SOS>   she held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry  though he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xi <EOS> <SOS>  mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation  that he never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear sister elizabeth  by introducing the subject of it  and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet <EOS> <SOS>  the day of his and lydia s departure soon came  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle  was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear lydia   she cried   when shall we meet again <EOS> <SOS>    oh  lord <EOS> <SOS>  i don t know <EOS> <SOS>  not these two or three years perhaps <EOS> <SOS>    write to me very often  my dear <EOS> <SOS>    as often as i can <EOS> <SOS>  but you know married women have never much time for writing <EOS> <SOS>  my sisters may write to  me  <EOS> <SOS>  they will have nothing else to do <EOS> <SOS>   mr wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s <EOS> <SOS>  he smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things <EOS> <SOS>   he is as fine a fellow   said mr bennet  as soon as they were out of the house   as ever i saw <EOS> <SOS>  he simpers  and smirks  and makes love to us all <EOS> <SOS>  i am prodigiously proud of him <EOS> <SOS>  i defy even sir william lucas himself  to produce a more valuable son in law <EOS> <SOS>   the loss of her daughter made mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet very dull for several days <EOS> <SOS>   i often think   said she   that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends <EOS> <SOS>  one seems so forlorn without them <EOS> <SOS>    this is the consequence you see  madam  of marrying a daughter   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single <EOS> <SOS>    it is no such thing <EOS> <SOS>  lydia does not leave me because she is married  but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off <EOS> <SOS>  if that had been nearer  she would not have gone so soon <EOS> <SOS>   but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into  was shortly relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope  by an article of news  which then began to be in circulation <EOS> <SOS>  the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master  who was coming down in a day or two  to shoot there for several weeks <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was quite in the fidgets <EOS> <SOS>  she looked at jane  and smiled  and shook her head by turns <EOS> <SOS>   well  well  and so mr bingley is coming down  sister    for mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips first brought her the news <EOS> <SOS>    well  so much the better <EOS> <SOS>  not that i care about it  though <EOS> <SOS>  he is nothing to us  you know  and i am sure  i  never want to see him again <EOS> <SOS>  but  however  he is very welcome to come to netherfield  if he likes it <EOS> <SOS>  and who knows what  may  happen <EOS> <SOS>  but that is nothing to us <EOS> <SOS>  you know  sister  we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it <EOS> <SOS>  and so  is it quite certain he is coming <EOS> <SOS>    you may depend on it   replied the other   for mr <EOS> <SOS>  nicholls was in meryton last night  i saw her passing by  and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was certain true <EOS> <SOS>  he comes down on thursday at the latest  very likely on wednesday <EOS> <SOS>  she was going to the butcher s  she told me  on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday  and she has got three couple of ducks  just fit to be killed <EOS> <SOS>   missennet had not been able to hear of his coming  without changing colour <EOS> <SOS>  it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together  she said   i saw you look at me to day  lizzy  when my aunt told us of the present report  and i know i appeared distressed <EOS> <SOS>  but don t imagine it was from any silly cause <EOS> <SOS>  i was only confused for the moment  because i felt that i  should  be looked at <EOS> <SOS>  i do assure you  that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain <EOS> <SOS>  i am glad of one thing  that he comes alone  because we shall see the less of him <EOS> <SOS>  not that i am afraid of  myself   but i dread other people s remarks <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth did not know what to make of it <EOS> <SOS>  had she not seen him in derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming there  with no other view than what was acknowledged  but she still thought him partial to jane  and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there  with  his friend s permission  or being bold enough to come without it <EOS> <SOS>   yet it is hard   she sometimes thought   that this poor man cannot come to a house  which he has legally hired  without raising all this speculation <EOS> <SOS>  i  will  leave him to himself <EOS> <SOS>   in spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be her feelings  in the expectation of his arrival  elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it <EOS> <SOS>  they were more disturbed  more unequal  than she had often seen them <EOS> <SOS>  the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents  about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again <EOS> <SOS>   as soon as ever mr bingley comes  my dear   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   you will wait on him of course <EOS> <SOS>    no  no <EOS> <SOS>  you forced me into visiting him last year  and promised if i went to see him  he should marry one of my daughters <EOS> <SOS>  but it ended in nothing  and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again <EOS> <SOS>   his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his returning to netherfield <EOS> <SOS>    tis an etiquette i despise   said he <EOS> <SOS>   if he wants our society  let him seek it <EOS> <SOS>  he knows where we live <EOS> <SOS>  i will not spend  my  hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away  and come back again <EOS> <SOS>    well  all i know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him <EOS> <SOS>  but  however  that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here  i am determined <EOS> <SOS>  we must have mr <EOS> <SOS>  long and the gouldings soon <EOS> <SOS>  that will make thirteen with ourselves  so there will be just room at table for him <EOS> <SOS>   consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it  before  they  did <EOS> <SOS>  as the day of his arrival drew near   i begin to be sorry that he comes at all   said jane to her sister <EOS> <SOS>   it would be nothing  i could see him with perfect indifference  but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of <EOS> <SOS>  my mother means well  but she does not know  no one can know how much i suffer from what she says <EOS> <SOS>  happy shall i be  when his stay at netherfield is over <EOS> <SOS>    i wish i could say any thing to comfort you   replied elizabeth   but it is wholly out of my power <EOS> <SOS>  you must feel it  and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me  because you have always so much <EOS> <SOS>   mr bingley arrived <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  through the assistance of servants  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side  might be as long as it could <EOS> <SOS>  she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent  hopeless of seeing him before <EOS> <SOS>  but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire  she saw him from her dressing room window  enter the paddock  and ride towards the house <EOS> <SOS>  her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy <EOS> <SOS>  jane resolutely kept her place at the table  but elizabeth  to satisfy her mother  went to the window  she looked   she saw mr darcy with him  and sat down again by her sister <EOS> <SOS>   there is a gentleman with him  mamma   said kitty   who can it be <EOS> <SOS>    some acquaintance or other  my dear  i suppose  i am sure i do not know <EOS> <SOS>    la <EOS> <SOS>   replied kitty   it looks just like that man that used to be with him before <EOS> <SOS>  mr what s his name <EOS> <SOS>  that tall  proud man <EOS> <SOS>    good gracious <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   and so it does i vow <EOS> <SOS>  well  any friend of mr bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure  but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him <EOS> <SOS>   jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern <EOS> <SOS>  she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire  and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter <EOS> <SOS>  both sisters were uncomfortable enough <EOS> <SOS>  each felt for the other  and of course for themselves  and their mother talked on  of her dislike of mr darcy  and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley s friend  without being heard by either of them <EOS> <SOS>  but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him <EOS> <SOS>  to jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused  and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own more extensive information  he was the person  to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits  and whom she regarded herself with an interest  if not quite so tender  at least as reasonable and just  as what jane felt for bingley <EOS> <SOS>  her astonishment at his coming  at his coming to netherfield  to longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire <EOS> <SOS>  the colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half a minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes  as she thought for that space of time  that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken <EOS> <SOS>  but she would not be secure <EOS> <SOS>   let me first see how he behaves   said she   it will then be early enough for expectation <EOS> <SOS>   she sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without daring to lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister  as the servant was approaching the door <EOS> <SOS>  jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than elizabeth had expected <EOS> <SOS>  on the gentlemen s appearing  her colour increased  yet she received them with tolerable ease  and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment  or any unnecessary complaisance <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and sat down again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not often command <EOS> <SOS>  she had ventured only one glance at darcy <EOS> <SOS>  he looked serious as usual  and she thought  more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  than as she had seen him at pemberley <EOS> <SOS>  but  perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt <EOS> <SOS>  it was a painful  but not an improbable  conjecture <EOS> <SOS>  bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed <EOS> <SOS>  he was received by mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet with a degree of civility  which made her two daughters ashamed  especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy  was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied <EOS> <SOS>  darcy  after enquiring of her how mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner did  a question which she could not answer without confusion  said scarcely any thing <EOS> <SOS>  he was not seated by her  perhaps that was the reason of his silence  but it had not been so in derbyshire <EOS> <SOS>  there he had talked to her friends  when he could not to herself <EOS> <SOS>  but now several minutes elapsed  without bringing the sound of his voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist the impulse of curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often found him looking at jane  as at herself  and frequently on no object but the ground <EOS> <SOS>  more thoughtfulness  and less anxiety to please than when they last met  were plainly expressed <EOS> <SOS>  she was disappointed  and angry with herself for being so <EOS> <SOS>   could i expect it to be otherwise <EOS> <SOS>   said she <EOS> <SOS>   yet why did he come <EOS> <SOS>   she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself  and to him she had hardly courage to speak <EOS> <SOS>  she enquired after his sister  but could do no more <EOS> <SOS>   it is a long time  mr bingley  since you went away   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet <EOS> <SOS>  he readily agreed to it <EOS> <SOS>   i began to be afraid you would never come back again <EOS> <SOS>  people  did  say  you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas  but  however  i hope it is not true <EOS> <SOS>  a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood  since you went away <EOS> <SOS>  missucas is married and settled <EOS> <SOS>  and one of my own daughters <EOS> <SOS>  i suppose you have heard of it  indeed  you must have seen it in the papers <EOS> <SOS>  it was in the times and the courier  i know  though it was not put in as it ought to be <EOS> <SOS>  it was only said   lately  george wickham  esq <EOS> <SOS>  to missydia bennet   without there being a syllable said of her father  or the place where she lived  or any thing <EOS> <SOS>  it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too  and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it <EOS> <SOS>  did you see it <EOS> <SOS>   bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes <EOS> <SOS>  how mr darcy looked  therefore  she could not tell <EOS> <SOS>   it is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well married   continued her mother   but at the same time  mr bingley  it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me <EOS> <SOS>  they are gone down to newcastle  a place quite northward  it seems  and there they are to stay  i do not know how long <EOS> <SOS>  his regiment is there  for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the     shire  and of his being gone into the regulars <EOS> <SOS>  thank heaven <EOS> <SOS>  he has  some  friends  though perhaps not so many as he deserves <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy  was in such misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat <EOS> <SOS>  it drew from her  however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else had so effectually done before  and she asked bingley  whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present <EOS> <SOS>  a few weeks  he believed <EOS> <SOS>   when you have killed all your own birds  mr bingley   said her mother   i beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you please  on mr bennet s manor <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you  and will save all the best of the covies for you <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious attention <EOS> <SOS>  were the same fair prospect to arise at present  as had flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion <EOS> <SOS>  at that instant she felt  that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends  for moments of such painful confusion <EOS> <SOS>   the first wish of my heart   said she to herself   is never more to be in company with either of them <EOS> <SOS>  their society can afford no pleasure  that will atone for such wretchedness as this <EOS> <SOS>  let me never see either one or the other again <EOS> <SOS>   yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover <EOS> <SOS>  when first he came in  he had spoken to her but little  but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention <EOS> <SOS>  he found her as handsome as she had been last year  as good natured  and as unaffected  though not quite so chatty <EOS> <SOS>  jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever <EOS> <SOS>  but her mind was so busily engaged  that she did not always know when she was silent <EOS> <SOS>  when the gentlemen rose to go away  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was mindful of her intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time <EOS> <SOS>   you are quite a visit in my debt  mr bingley   she added   for when you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family dinner with us  as soon as you returned <EOS> <SOS>  i have not forgot  you see  and i assure you  i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement <EOS> <SOS>   bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said something of his concern  at having been prevented by business <EOS> <SOS>  they then went away <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there  that day  but  though she always kept a very good table  she did not think any thing less than two courses  could be good enough for a man  on whom she had such anxious designs  or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xii <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as they were gone  elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits  or in other words  to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her <EOS> <SOS>   why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent   said she   did he come at all <EOS> <SOS>   she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure <EOS> <SOS>   he could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt  when he was in town  and why not to me <EOS> <SOS>  if he fears me  why come hither <EOS> <SOS>  if he no longer cares for me  why silent <EOS> <SOS>  teazing  teazing  man <EOS> <SOS>  i will think no more about him <EOS> <SOS>   her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look  which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors  than elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   now   said she   that this first meeting is over  i feel perfectly easy <EOS> <SOS>  i know my own strength  and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming <EOS> <SOS>  i am glad he dines here on tuesday <EOS> <SOS>  it will then be publicly seen  that on both sides  we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance <EOS> <SOS>    yes  very indifferent indeed   said elizabeth  laughingly <EOS> <SOS>   oh  jane  take care <EOS> <SOS>    my dear lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger now <EOS> <SOS>    i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever <EOS> <SOS>                                            they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  in the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy schemes  which the good humour  and common politeness of bingley  in half an hour s visit  had revived <EOS> <SOS>  on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  and the two  who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen  were in very good time <EOS> <SOS>  when they repaired to the dining room  elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place  which  in all their former parties  had belonged to him  by her sister <EOS> <SOS>  her prudent mother  occupied by the same ideas  forbore to invite him to sit by herself <EOS> <SOS>  on entering the room  he seemed to hesitate  but jane happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was decided <EOS> <SOS>  he placed himself by her <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his friend <EOS> <SOS>  he bore it with noble indifference  and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy  with an expression of half laughing alarm <EOS> <SOS>  his behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as shewed an admiration of her  which  though more guarded than formerly  persuaded elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself  jane s happiness  and his own  would be speedily secured <EOS> <SOS>  though she dared not depend upon the consequence  she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour <EOS> <SOS>  it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in no cheerful humour <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy was almost as far from her  as the table could divide them <EOS> <SOS>  he was on one side of her mother <EOS> <SOS>  she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either  or make either appear to advantage <EOS> <SOS>  she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse  but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other  and how formal and cold was their manner  whenever they did <EOS> <SOS>  her mother s ungraciousness  made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind  and she would  at times  have given any thing to be privileged to tell him  that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family <EOS> <SOS>  she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation  than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance <EOS> <SOS>  anxious and uneasy  the period which passed in the drawing room  before the gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull to a degree  that almost made her uncivil <EOS> <SOS>  she looked forward to their entrance  as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend <EOS> <SOS>   if he does not come to me   then    said she   i shall give him up for ever <EOS> <SOS>   the gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes  but  alas <EOS> <SOS>  the ladies had crowded round the table  where missennet was making tea  and elizabeth pouring out the coffee  in so close a confederacy  that there was not a single vacancy near her  which would admit of a chair <EOS> <SOS>  and on the gentlemen s approaching  one of the girls moved closer to her than ever  and said  in a whisper   the men shan t come and part us  i am determined <EOS> <SOS>  we want none of them  do we <EOS> <SOS>   darcy had walked away to another part of the room <EOS> <SOS>  she followed him with her eyes  envied every one to whom he spoke  had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged against herself for being so silly <EOS> <SOS>   a man who has once been refused <EOS> <SOS>  how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love <EOS> <SOS>  is there one among the sex  who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman <EOS> <SOS>  there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings <EOS> <SOS>   she was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his coffee cup himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying   is your sister at pemberley still <EOS> <SOS>    yes  she will remain there till christmas <EOS> <SOS>    and quite alone <EOS> <SOS>  have all her friends left her <EOS> <SOS>    mr <EOS> <SOS>  annesley is with her <EOS> <SOS>  the others have been gone on to scarborough  these three weeks <EOS> <SOS>   she could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to converse with her  he might have better success <EOS> <SOS>  he stood by her  however  for some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again  he walked away <EOS> <SOS>  when the tea things were removed  and the card tables placed  the ladies all rose  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him  when all her views were overthrown  by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players  and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party <EOS> <SOS>  she now lost every expectation of pleasure <EOS> <SOS>  they were confined for the evening at different tables  and she had nothing to hope  but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room  as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them <EOS> <SOS>   well girls   said she  as soon as they were left to themselves   what say you to the day <EOS> <SOS>  i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well  i assure you <EOS> <SOS>  the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw <EOS> <SOS>  the venison was roasted to a turn  and everybody said  they never saw so fat a haunch <EOS> <SOS>  the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week  and even mr darcy acknowledged  that the partridges were remarkably well done  and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least <EOS> <SOS>  and  my dear jane  i never saw you look in greater beauty <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  long said so too  for i asked her whether you did not <EOS> <SOS>  and what do you think she said besides <EOS> <SOS>   ah <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  we shall have her at netherfield at last <EOS> <SOS>   she did indeed <EOS> <SOS>  i do think mr <EOS> <SOS>  long is as good a creature as ever lived  and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls  and not at all handsome  i like them prodigiously <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane  to be convinced that she would get him at last  and her expectations of advantage to her family  when in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day  to make his proposals <EOS> <SOS>   it has been a very agreeable day   said missennet to elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   the party seemed so well selected  so suitable one with the other <EOS> <SOS>  i hope we may often meet again <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth smiled <EOS> <SOS>   lizzy  you must not do so <EOS> <SOS>  you must not suspect me <EOS> <SOS>  it mortifies me <EOS> <SOS>  i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish beyond it <EOS> <SOS>  i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are  that he never had any design of engaging my affection <EOS> <SOS>  it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address  and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man <EOS> <SOS>    you are very cruel   said her sister   you will not let me smile  and are provoking me to it every moment <EOS> <SOS>    how hard it is in some cases to be believed <EOS> <SOS>    and how impossible in others <EOS> <SOS>    but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge <EOS> <SOS>    that is a question which i hardly know how to answer <EOS> <SOS>  we all love to instruct  though we can teach only what is not worth knowing <EOS> <SOS>  forgive me  and if you persist in indifference  do not make  me  your confidante <EOS> <SOS>   chapter xiii <EOS> <SOS>  a few days after this visit  mr bingley called again  and alone <EOS> <SOS>  his friend had left him that morning for london  but was to return home in ten days time <EOS> <SOS>  he sat with them above an hour  and was in remarkably good spirits <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet invited him to dine with them  but  with many expressions of concern  he confessed himself engaged elsewhere <EOS> <SOS>   next time you call   said she   i hope we shall be more lucky <EOS> <SOS>   he should be particularly happy at any time   c <EOS> <SOS>   c <EOS> <SOS>   and if she would give him leave  would take an early opportunity of waiting on them <EOS> <SOS>   can you come to morrow <EOS> <SOS>   yes  he had no engagement at all for to morrow  and her invitation was accepted with alacrity <EOS> <SOS>  he came  and in such very good time  that the ladies were none of them dressed <EOS> <SOS>  in ran mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet to her daughter s room  in her dressing gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out   my dear jane  make haste and hurry down <EOS> <SOS>  he is come  mr bingley is come <EOS> <SOS>   he is  indeed <EOS> <SOS>  make haste  make haste <EOS> <SOS>  here  sarah  come to missennet this moment  and help her on with her gown <EOS> <SOS>  never mind missizzy s hair <EOS> <SOS>    we will be down as soon as we can   said jane   but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us  for she went up stairs half an hour ago <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  hang kitty <EOS> <SOS>  what has she to do with it <EOS> <SOS>  come be quick  be quick <EOS> <SOS>  where is your sash my dear <EOS> <SOS>   but when her mother was gone  jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters <EOS> <SOS>  the same anxiety to get them by themselves  was visible again in the evening <EOS> <SOS>  after tea  mr bennet retired to the library  as was his custom  and mary went up stairs to her instrument <EOS> <SOS>  two obstacles of the five being thus removed  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time  without making any impression on them <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth would not observe her  and when at last kitty did  she very innocently said   what is the matter mamma <EOS> <SOS>  what do you keep winking at me for <EOS> <SOS>  what am i to do <EOS> <SOS>    nothing child  nothing <EOS> <SOS>  i did not wink at you <EOS> <SOS>   she then sat still five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious occasion  she suddenly got up  and saying to kitty   come here  my love  i want to speak to you   took her out of the room <EOS> <SOS>  jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth  which spoke her distress at such premeditation  and her intreaty that  she  would not give into it <EOS> <SOS>  in a few minutes  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet half opened the door and called out   lizzy  my dear  i want to speak with you <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was forced to go <EOS> <SOS>   we may as well leave them by themselves you know   said her mother as soon as she was in the hall <EOS> <SOS>   kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained quietly in the hall  till she and kitty were out of sight  then returned into the drawing room <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was every thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her daughter <EOS> <SOS>  his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party  and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance  particularly grateful to the daughter <EOS> <SOS>  he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  and before he went away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s means  for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband <EOS> <SOS>  after this day  jane said no more of her indifference <EOS> <SOS>  not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley  but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded  unless mr darcy returned within the stated time <EOS> <SOS>  seriously  however  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence <EOS> <SOS>  bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and mr bennet spent the morning together  as had been agreed on <EOS> <SOS>  the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected <EOS> <SOS>  there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley  that could provoke his ridicule  or disgust him into silence  and he was more communicative  and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him <EOS> <SOS>  bingley of course returned with him to dinner  and in the evening mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  who had a letter to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea  for as the others were all going to sit down to cards  she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes <EOS> <SOS>  but on returning to the drawing room  when her letter was finished  she saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her <EOS> <SOS>  on opening the door  she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth  as if engaged in earnest conversation  and had this led to no suspicion  the faces of both as they hastily turned round  and moved away from each other  would have told it all <EOS> <SOS>   their  situation was awkward enough  but  her s  she thought was still worse <EOS> <SOS>  not a syllable was uttered by either  and elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when bingley  who as well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering a few words to her sister  ran out of the room <EOS> <SOS>  jane could have no reserves from elizabeth  where confidence would give pleasure  and instantly embracing her  acknowledged  with the liveliest emotion  that she was the happiest creature in the world <EOS> <SOS>    tis too much <EOS> <SOS>   she added   by far too much <EOS> <SOS>  i do not deserve it <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  why is not every body as happy <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a warmth  a delight  which words could but poorly express <EOS> <SOS>  every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane <EOS> <SOS>  but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half that remained to be said  for the present <EOS> <SOS>   i must go instantly to my mother   she cried <EOS> <SOS>   i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  or allow her to hear it from any one but myself <EOS> <SOS>  he is gone to my father already <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  lizzy  to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family <EOS> <SOS>  how shall i bear so much happiness <EOS> <SOS>   she then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up the card party  and was sitting up stairs with kitty <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled  that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation <EOS> <SOS>   and this   said she   is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection <EOS> <SOS>  of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance <EOS> <SOS>  the happiest  wisest  most reasonable end <EOS> <SOS>   in a few minutes she was joined by bingley  whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose <EOS> <SOS>   where is your sister <EOS> <SOS>   said he hastily  as he opened the door <EOS> <SOS>   with my mother up stairs <EOS> <SOS>  she will be down in a moment i dare say <EOS> <SOS>   he then shut the door  and coming up to her  claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship <EOS> <SOS>  they shook hands with great cordiality  and then till her sister came down  she had to listen to all he had to say  of his own happiness  and of jane s perfections  and in spite of his being a lover  elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity  to be rationally founded  because they had for basis the excellent understanding  and super excellent disposition of jane  and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself <EOS> <SOS>  it was an evening of no common delight to them all  the satisfaction of missennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face  as made her look handsomer than ever <EOS> <SOS>  kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped her turn was coming soon <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet could not give her consent  or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  though she talked to bingley of nothing else  for half an hour  and when mr bennet joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was <EOS> <SOS>  not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till their visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was gone  he turned to his daughter and said   jane  i congratulate you <EOS> <SOS>  you will be a very happy woman <EOS> <SOS>   jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his goodness <EOS> <SOS>   you are a good girl   he replied   and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled <EOS> <SOS>  i have not a doubt of your doing very well together <EOS> <SOS>  your tempers are by no means unlike <EOS> <SOS>  you are each of you so complying  that nothing will ever be resolved on  so easy  that every servant will cheat you  and so generous  that you will always exceed your income <EOS> <SOS>    i hope not so <EOS> <SOS>  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters  would be unpardonable in  me  <EOS> <SOS>    exceed their income <EOS> <SOS>  my dear mr bennet   cried his wife   what are you talking of <EOS> <SOS>  why  he has four or five thousand a year  and very likely more <EOS> <SOS>   then addressing her daughter   oh <EOS> <SOS>  my dear  dear jane  i am so happy <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night <EOS> <SOS>  i knew how it would be <EOS> <SOS>  i always said it must be so  at last <EOS> <SOS>  i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing <EOS> <SOS>  i remember  as soon as ever i saw him  when he first came into hertfordshire last year  i thought how likely it was that you should come together <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen <EOS> <SOS>   wickham  lydia  were all forgotten <EOS> <SOS>  jane was beyond competition her favourite child <EOS> <SOS>  at that moment  she cared for no other <EOS> <SOS>  her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense <EOS> <SOS>  mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter <EOS> <SOS>  bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at longbourn  coming frequently before breakfast  and always remaining till after supper  unless when some barbarous neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an invitation to dinner  which he thought himself obliged to accept <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister  for while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow on any one else  but she found herself considerably useful to both of them  in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur <EOS> <SOS>  in the absence of jane  he always attached himself to elizabeth  for the pleasure of talking of her  and when bingley was gone  jane constantly sought the same means of relief <EOS> <SOS>   he has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me  that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring <EOS> <SOS>  i had not believed it possible <EOS> <SOS>    i suspected as much   replied elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   but how did he account for it <EOS> <SOS>    it must have been his sister s doing <EOS> <SOS>  they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at  since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects <EOS> <SOS>  but when they see  as i trust they will  that their brother is happy with me  they will learn to be contented  and we shall be on good terms again  though we can never be what we once were to each other <EOS> <SOS>    that is the most unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i ever heard you utter <EOS> <SOS>  good girl <EOS> <SOS>  it would vex me  indeed  to see you again the dupe of missingley s pretended regard <EOS> <SOS>    would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last november  he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being indifferent  would have prevented his coming down again <EOS> <SOS>    he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of his modesty <EOS> <SOS>   this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good qualities <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth was pleased to find  that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend  for  though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him <EOS> <SOS>   i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed <EOS> <SOS>   cried jane <EOS> <SOS>   oh <EOS> <SOS>  lizzy  why am i thus singled from my family  and blessed above them all <EOS> <SOS>  if i could but see  you  as happy <EOS> <SOS>  if there  were  but such another man for you <EOS> <SOS>    if you were to give me forty such men  i never could be so happy as you <EOS> <SOS>  till i have your disposition  your goodness  i never can have your happiness <EOS> <SOS>  no  no  let me shift for myself  and  perhaps  if i have very good luck  i may meet with another mr collins in time <EOS> <SOS>   the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was privileged to whisper it to mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  and  she  ventured  without any permission  to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton <EOS> <SOS>  the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world  though only a few weeks before  when lydia had first run away  they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xiv <EOS> <SOS>  one morning  about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window  by the sound of a carriage  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn <EOS> <SOS>  it was too early in the morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours <EOS> <SOS>  the horses were post  and neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded it  were familiar to them <EOS> <SOS>  as it was certain  however  that somebody was coming  bingley instantly prevailed on missennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with him into the shrubbery <EOS> <SOS>  they both set off  and the conjectures of the remaining three continued  though with little satisfaction  till the door was thrown open  and their visitor entered <EOS> <SOS>  it was lady catherine de bourgh <EOS> <SOS>  they were of course all intending to be surprised  but their astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet and kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them  even inferior to what elizabeth felt <EOS> <SOS>  she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious  made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation  than a slight inclination of the head  and sat down without saying a word <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother  on her ladyship s entrance  though no request of introduction had been made <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness <EOS> <SOS>  after sitting for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to elizabeth   i hope you are well  missennet <EOS> <SOS>  that lady i suppose is your mother <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth replied very concisely that she was <EOS> <SOS>   and  that  i suppose is one of your sisters <EOS> <SOS>    yes  madam   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  delighted to speak to a lady catherine <EOS> <SOS>   she is my youngest girl but one <EOS> <SOS>  my youngest of all  is lately married  and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds  walking with a young man  who i believe will soon become a part of the family <EOS> <SOS>    you have a very small park here   returned lady catherine after a short silence <EOS> <SOS>   it is nothing in comparison of rosings  my lady  i dare say  but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s <EOS> <SOS>    this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening  in summer  the windows are full west <EOS> <SOS>   mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  and then added   may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins well <EOS> <SOS>    yes  very well <EOS> <SOS>  i saw them the night before last <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling <EOS> <SOS>  but no letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take some refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not very politely  declined eating any thing  and then rising up  said to elizabeth   missennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn <EOS> <SOS>  i should be glad to take a turn in it  if you will favour me with your company <EOS> <SOS>    go  my dear   cried her mother   and shew her ladyship about the different walks <EOS> <SOS>  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol  attended her noble guest down stairs <EOS> <SOS>  as they passed through the hall  lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be decent looking rooms  walked on <EOS> <SOS>  her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it <EOS> <SOS>  they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman  who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable <EOS> <SOS>   how could i ever think her like her nephew <EOS> <SOS>   said she  as she looked in her face <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as they entered the copse  lady catherine began in the following manner     you can be at no loss  missennet  to understand the reason of my journey hither <EOS> <SOS>  your own heart  your own conscience  must tell you why i come <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment <EOS> <SOS>   indeed  you are mistaken  madam <EOS> <SOS>  i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here <EOS> <SOS>    missennet   replied her ladyship  in an angry tone   you ought to know  that i am not to be trifled with <EOS> <SOS>  but however insincere  you  may choose to be  you shall not find  me  so <EOS> <SOS>  my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in a cause of such moment as this  i shall certainly not depart from it <EOS> <SOS>  a report of a most alarming nature  reached me two days ago <EOS> <SOS>  i was told  that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married  but that  you   that misslizabeth bennet  would  in all likelihood  be soon afterwards united to my nephew  my own nephew  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  though i  know  it must be a scandalous falsehood  though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible  i instantly resolved on setting off for this place  that i might make my sentiments known to you <EOS> <SOS>    if you believed it impossible to be true   said elizabeth  colouring with astonishment and disdain   i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far <EOS> <SOS>  what could your ladyship propose by it <EOS> <SOS>    at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted <EOS> <SOS>    your coming to longbourn  to see me and my family   said elizabeth  coolly   will be rather a confirmation of it  if  indeed  such a report is in existence <EOS> <SOS>    if <EOS> <SOS>  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it <EOS> <SOS>  has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves <EOS> <SOS>  do you not know that such a report is spread abroad <EOS> <SOS>    i never heard that it was <EOS> <SOS>    and can you likewise declare  that there is no  foundation  for it <EOS> <SOS>    i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship <EOS> <SOS>   you  may ask questions  which  i  shall not choose to answer <EOS> <SOS>    this is not to be borne <EOS> <SOS>  missennet  i insist on being satisfied <EOS> <SOS>  has he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage <EOS> <SOS>    your ladyship has declared it to be impossible <EOS> <SOS>    it ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of his reason <EOS> <SOS>  but  your  arts and allurements may  in a moment of infatuation  have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family <EOS> <SOS>  you may have drawn him in <EOS> <SOS>    if i have  i shall be the last person to confess it <EOS> <SOS>    missennet  do you know who i am <EOS> <SOS>  i have not been accustomed to such language as this <EOS> <SOS>  i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world  and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns <EOS> <SOS>    but you are not entitled to know  mine   nor will such behaviour as this  ever induce me to be explicit <EOS> <SOS>    let me be rightly understood <EOS> <SOS>  this match  to which you have the presumption to aspire  can never take place <EOS> <SOS>  no  never <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy is engaged to  my daughter  <EOS> <SOS>  now what have you to say <EOS> <SOS>    only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied   the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind <EOS> <SOS>  from their infancy  they have been intended for each other <EOS> <SOS>  it was the favourite wish of  his  mother  as well as of her s <EOS> <SOS>  while in their cradles  we planned the union  and now  at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished  in their marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth  of no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to the family <EOS> <SOS>  do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends <EOS> <SOS>  to his tacit engagement with misse bourgh <EOS> <SOS>  are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy <EOS> <SOS>  have you not heard me say  that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin <EOS> <SOS>    yes  and i had heard it before <EOS> <SOS>  but what is that to me <EOS> <SOS>  if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew  i shall certainly not be kept from it  by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry misse bourgh <EOS> <SOS>  you both did as much as you could  in planning the marriage <EOS> <SOS>  its completion depended on others <EOS> <SOS>  if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin  why is not he to make another choice <EOS> <SOS>  and if i am that choice  why may not i accept him <EOS> <SOS>    because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it <EOS> <SOS>  yes  missennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends  if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all <EOS> <SOS>  you will be censured  slighted  and despised  by every one connected with him <EOS> <SOS>  your alliance will be a disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned by any of us <EOS> <SOS>    these are heavy misfortunes   replied elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation  that she could  upon the whole  have no cause to repine <EOS> <SOS>    obstinate  headstrong girl <EOS> <SOS>  i am ashamed of you <EOS> <SOS>  is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring <EOS> <SOS>  is nothing due to me on that score <EOS> <SOS>   let us sit down <EOS> <SOS>  you are to understand  missennet  that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose  nor will i be dissuaded from it <EOS> <SOS>  i have not been used to submit to any person s whims <EOS> <SOS>  i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment <EOS> <SOS>     that  will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable  but it will have no effect on  me  <EOS> <SOS>    i will not be interrupted <EOS> <SOS>  hear me in silence <EOS> <SOS>  my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other <EOS> <SOS>  they are descended on the maternal side  from the same noble line  and  on the father s  from respectable  honourable  and ancient  though untitled families <EOS> <SOS>  their fortune on both sides is splendid <EOS> <SOS>  they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses  and what is to divide them <EOS> <SOS>  the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family  connections  or fortune <EOS> <SOS>  is this to be endured <EOS> <SOS>  but it must not  shall not be <EOS> <SOS>  if you were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit the sphere  in which you have been brought up <EOS> <SOS>    in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere <EOS> <SOS>  he is a gentleman  i am a gentleman s daughter  so far we are equal <EOS> <SOS>    true <EOS> <SOS>  you  are  a gentleman s daughter <EOS> <SOS>  but who was your mother <EOS> <SOS>  who are your uncles and aunts <EOS> <SOS>  do not imagine me ignorant of their condition <EOS> <SOS>    whatever my connections may be   said elizabeth   if your nephew does not object to them  they can be nothing to  you  <EOS> <SOS>    tell me once for all  are you engaged to him <EOS> <SOS>   though elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say  after a moment s deliberation   i am not <EOS> <SOS>   lady catherine seemed pleased <EOS> <SOS>   and will you promise me  never to enter into such an engagement <EOS> <SOS>    i will make no promise of the kind <EOS> <SOS>    missennet i am shocked and astonished <EOS> <SOS>  i expected to find a more reasonable young woman <EOS> <SOS>  but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede <EOS> <SOS>  i shall not go away  till you have given me the assurance i require <EOS> <SOS>    and i certainly  never  shall give it <EOS> <SOS>  i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable <EOS> <SOS>  your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter  but would my giving you the wished for promise  make  their  marriage at all more probable <EOS> <SOS>  supposing him to be attached to me  would  my  refusing to accept his hand  make him wish to bestow it on his cousin <EOS> <SOS>  allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application  have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged <EOS> <SOS>  you have widely mistaken my character  if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these <EOS> <SOS>  how far your nephew might approve of your interference in  his  affairs  i cannot tell  but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine <EOS> <SOS>  i must beg  therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject <EOS> <SOS>    not so hasty  if you please <EOS> <SOS>  i have by no means done <EOS> <SOS>  to all the objections i have already urged  i have still another to add <EOS> <SOS>  i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement <EOS> <SOS>  i know it all  that the young man s marrying her  was a patched up business  at the expence of your father and uncles <EOS> <SOS>  and is  such  a girl to be my nephew s sister <EOS> <SOS>  is  her  husband  is the son of his late father s steward  to be his brother <EOS> <SOS>  heaven and earth <EOS> <SOS>   of what are you thinking <EOS> <SOS>  are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted <EOS> <SOS>    you can  now  have nothing farther to say   she resentfully answered <EOS> <SOS>   you have insulted me  in every possible method <EOS> <SOS>  i must beg to return to the house <EOS> <SOS>   and she rose as she spoke <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine rose also  and they turned back <EOS> <SOS>  her ladyship was highly incensed <EOS> <SOS>   you have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my nephew <EOS> <SOS>  unfeeling  selfish girl <EOS> <SOS>  do you not consider that a connection with you  must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody <EOS> <SOS>    lady catherine  i have nothing farther to say <EOS> <SOS>  you know my sentiments <EOS> <SOS>    you are then resolved to have him <EOS> <SOS>    i have said no such thing <EOS> <SOS>  i am only resolved to act in that manner  which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness  without reference to  you   or to any person so wholly unconnected with me <EOS> <SOS>    it is well <EOS> <SOS>  you refuse  then  to oblige me <EOS> <SOS>  you refuse to obey the claims of duty  honour  and gratitude <EOS> <SOS>  you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends  and make him the contempt of the world <EOS> <SOS>    neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude   replied elizabeth   have any possible claim on me  in the present instance <EOS> <SOS>  no principle of either  would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  and with regard to the resentment of his family  or the indignation of the world  if the former  were  excited by his marrying me  it would not give me one moment s concern  and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn <EOS> <SOS>    and this is your real opinion <EOS> <SOS>  this is your final resolve <EOS> <SOS>  very well <EOS> <SOS>  i shall now know how to act <EOS> <SOS>  do not imagine  missennet  that your ambition will ever be gratified <EOS> <SOS>  i came to try you <EOS> <SOS>  i hoped to find you reasonable  but depend upon it i will carry my point <EOS> <SOS>   in this manner lady catherine talked on  till they were at the door of the carriage  when turning hastily round  she added   i take no leave of you  missennet <EOS> <SOS>  i send no compliments to your mother <EOS> <SOS>  you deserve no such attention <EOS> <SOS>  i am most seriously displeased <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it herself <EOS> <SOS>  she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs <EOS> <SOS>  her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room  to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself <EOS> <SOS>   she did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go <EOS> <SOS>    she is a very fine looking woman <EOS> <SOS>  and her calling here was prodigiously civil <EOS> <SOS>  for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the collinses were well <EOS> <SOS>  she is on her road somewhere  i dare say  and so passing through meryton  thought she might as well call on you <EOS> <SOS>  i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xv <EOS> <SOS>  the discomposure of spirits  which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she for many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  it was a rational scheme to be sure <EOS> <SOS>  but from what the report of their engagement could originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  till she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of bingley  and  her  being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the expectation of one wedding  made every body eager for another  to supply the idea <EOS> <SOS>  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together <EOS> <SOS>  and her neighbours at lucas lodge  therefore   for through their communication with the collinses  the report she concluded had reached lady catherine  had only set  that  down  as almost certain and immediate  which  she  had looked forward to as possible  at some future time <EOS> <SOS>  in revolving lady catherine s expressions  however  she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference <EOS> <SOS>  from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew  and how  he  might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce <EOS> <SOS>  she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it was certain  that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one   whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  his aunt would address him on his weakest side <EOS> <SOS>  with his notions of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good sense and solid reasoning <EOS> <SOS>  if he had been wavering before  as to what he should do  which had often seemed likely  the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to be as happy  as dignity unblemished could make him <EOS> <SOS>  in that case he would return no more <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine might see him in her way through town  and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way <EOS> <SOS>   if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise  should come to his friend within a few days   she added   i shall know how to understand it <EOS> <SOS>  i shall then give over every expectation  every wish of his constancy <EOS> <SOS>  if he is satisfied with only regretting me  when he might have obtained my affections and hand  i shall soon cease to regret him at all <EOS> <SOS>                                            the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their visitor had been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied it  with the same kind of supposition  which had appeased mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s curiosity  and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject <EOS> <SOS>  the next morning  as she was going down stairs  she was met by her father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand <EOS> <SOS>   lizzy   said he   i was going to look for you  come into my room <EOS> <SOS>   she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her  was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held <EOS> <SOS>  it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations <EOS> <SOS>  she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat down <EOS> <SOS>  he then said   i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly <EOS> <SOS>  as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to know its contents <EOS> <SOS>  i did not know before  that i had  two  daughters on the brink of matrimony <EOS> <SOS>  let me congratulate you  on a very important conquest <EOS> <SOS>   the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  instead of the aunt  and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself  when her father continued   you look conscious <EOS> <SOS>  young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these  but i think i may defy even  your  sagacity  to discover the name of your admirer <EOS> <SOS>  this letter is from mr collins <EOS> <SOS>    from mr collins <EOS> <SOS>  and what can  he  have to say <EOS> <SOS>    something very much to the purpose of course <EOS> <SOS>  he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter  of which it seems he has been told  by some of the good natured  gossiping lucases <EOS> <SOS>  i shall not sport with your impatience  by reading what he says on that point <EOS> <SOS>  what relates to yourself  is as follows <EOS> <SOS>   having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mr <EOS> <SOS>  collins and myself on this happy event  let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  of which we have been advertised by the same authority <EOS> <SOS>  your daughter elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet  after her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of her fate  may be reasonably looked up to  as one of the most illustrious personages in this land <EOS> <SOS>    can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this <EOS> <SOS>    this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way  with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire   splendid property  noble kindred  and extensive patronage <EOS> <SOS>  yet in spite of all these temptations  let me warn my cousin elizabeth  and yourself  of what evils you may incur  by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals  which  of course  you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of <EOS> <SOS>    have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is <EOS> <SOS>  but now it comes out <EOS> <SOS>    my motive for cautioning you  is as follows <EOS> <SOS>  we have reason to imagine that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on the match with a friendly eye <EOS> <SOS>     mr darcy   you see  is the man <EOS> <SOS>  now  lizzy  i think i  have  surprised you <EOS> <SOS>  could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man  within the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy  who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish  and who probably never looked at  you  in his life <EOS> <SOS>  it is admirable <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could only force one most reluctant smile <EOS> <SOS>  never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her <EOS> <SOS>   are you not diverted <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  yes <EOS> <SOS>  pray read on <EOS> <SOS>    after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night  she immediately  with her usual condescension  expressed what she felt on the occasion  when it became apparent  that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin  she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match <EOS> <SOS>  i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned <EOS> <SOS>    mr collins moreover adds    i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up  and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place  should be so generally known <EOS> <SOS>  i must not  however  neglect the duties of my station  or refrain from declaring my amazement  at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married <EOS> <SOS>  it was an encouragement of vice  and had i been the rector of longbourn  i should very strenuously have opposed it <EOS> <SOS>  you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing <EOS> <SOS>     that  is his notion of christian forgiveness <EOS> <SOS>  the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation  and his expectation of a young olive branch <EOS> <SOS>  but  lizzy  you look as if you did not enjoy it <EOS> <SOS>  you are not going to be  misssh   i hope  and pretend to be affronted at an idle report <EOS> <SOS>  for what do we live  but to make sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our turn <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>   cried elizabeth   i am excessively diverted <EOS> <SOS>  but it is so strange <EOS> <SOS>    yes   that  is what makes it amusing <EOS> <SOS>  had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference  and  your  pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd <EOS> <SOS>  much as i abominate writing  i would not give up mr collins s correspondence for any consideration <EOS> <SOS>  nay  when i read a letter of his  i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham  much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law <EOS> <SOS>  and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine about this report <EOS> <SOS>  did she call to refuse her consent <EOS> <SOS>   to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not distressed by his repeating it <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not <EOS> <SOS>  it was necessary to laugh  when she would rather have cried <EOS> <SOS>  her father had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of mr darcy s indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too  little   she might have fancied too  much  <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xvi <EOS> <SOS>  instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do  he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit <EOS> <SOS>  the gentlemen arrived early  and  before mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  bingley  who wanted to be alone with jane  proposed their all walking out <EOS> <SOS>  it was agreed to <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet was not in the habit of walking  mary could never spare time  but the remaining five set off together <EOS> <SOS>  bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip them <EOS> <SOS>  they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy  were to entertain each other <EOS> <SOS>  very little was said by either  kitty was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the same <EOS> <SOS>  they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call upon maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern  when kitty left them  she went boldly on with him alone <EOS> <SOS>  now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and  while her courage was high  she immediately said   mr darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be wounding your s <EOS> <SOS>  i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister <EOS> <SOS>  ever since i have known it  i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it <EOS> <SOS>  were it known to the rest of my family  i should not have merely my own gratitude to express <EOS> <SOS>    i am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied darcy  in a tone of surprise and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what may  in a mistaken light  have given you uneasiness <EOS> <SOS>  i did not think mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner was so little to be trusted <EOS> <SOS>    you must not blame my aunt <EOS> <SOS>  lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of course  i could not rest till i knew the particulars <EOS> <SOS>  let me thank you again and again  in the name of all my family  for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble  and bear so many mortifications  for the sake of discovering them <EOS> <SOS>    if you  will  thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself alone <EOS> <SOS>  that the wish of giving happiness to you  might add force to the other inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to deny <EOS> <SOS>  but your  family  owe me nothing <EOS> <SOS>  much as i respect them  i believe  i thought only of  you  <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word <EOS> <SOS>  after a short pause  her companion added   you are too generous to trifle with me <EOS> <SOS>  if your feelings are still what they were last april  tell me so at once <EOS> <SOS>   my  affections and wishes are unchanged  but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak  and immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand  that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure  his present assurances <EOS> <SOS>  the happiness which this reply produced  was such as he had probably never felt before  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do <EOS> <SOS>  had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight  diffused over his face  became him  but  though she could not look  she could listen  and he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable <EOS> <SOS>  they walked on  without knowing in what direction <EOS> <SOS>  there was too much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any other objects <EOS> <SOS>  she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who  did  call on him in her return through london  and there relate her journey to longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter  which  in her ladyship s apprehension  peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew  which  she  had refused to give <EOS> <SOS>  but  unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly contrariwise <EOS> <SOS>   it taught me to hope   said he   as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before <EOS> <SOS>  i knew enough of your disposition to be certain  that  had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided against me  you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine  frankly and openly <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   yes  you know enough of my  frankness  to believe me capable of  that  <EOS> <SOS>  after abusing you so abominably to your face  i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations <EOS> <SOS>    what did you say of me  that i did not deserve <EOS> <SOS>  for  though your accusations were ill founded  formed on mistaken premises  my behaviour to you at the time  had merited the severest reproof <EOS> <SOS>  it was unpardonable <EOS> <SOS>  i cannot think of it without abhorrence <EOS> <SOS>    we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   the conduct of neither  if strictly examined  will be irreproachable  but since then  we have both  i hope  improved in civility <EOS> <SOS>    i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself <EOS> <SOS>  the recollection of what i then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions during the whole of it  is now  and has been many months  inexpressibly painful to me <EOS> <SOS>  your reproof  so well applied  i shall never forget   had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner <EOS> <SOS>   those were your words <EOS> <SOS>  you know not  you can scarcely conceive  how they have tortured me   though it was some time  i confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice <EOS> <SOS>    i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression <EOS> <SOS>  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way <EOS> <SOS>    i can easily believe it <EOS> <SOS>  you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling  i am sure you did <EOS> <SOS>  the turn of your countenance i shall never forget  as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way  that would induce you to accept me <EOS> <SOS>    oh <EOS> <SOS>  do not repeat what i then said <EOS> <SOS>  these recollections will not do at all <EOS> <SOS>  i assure you  that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it <EOS> <SOS>   darcy mentioned his letter <EOS> <SOS>   did it   said he   did it  soon  make you think better of me <EOS> <SOS>  did you  on reading it  give any credit to its contents <EOS> <SOS>   she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed <EOS> <SOS>   i knew   said he   that what i wrote must give you pain  but it was necessary <EOS> <SOS>  i hope you have destroyed the letter <EOS> <SOS>  there was one part especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your having the power of reading again <EOS> <SOS>  i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me <EOS> <SOS>    the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i hope  quite so easily changed as that implies <EOS> <SOS>    when i wrote that letter   replied darcy   i believed myself perfectly calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit <EOS> <SOS>    the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so <EOS> <SOS>  the adieu is charity itself <EOS> <SOS>  but think no more of the letter <EOS> <SOS>  the feelings of the person who wrote  and the person who received it  are now so widely different from what they were then  that every unpleasant circumstance attending it  ought to be forgotten <EOS> <SOS>  you must learn some of my philosophy <EOS> <SOS>  think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure <EOS> <SOS>    i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind <EOS> <SOS>   your  retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the contentment arising from them  is not of philosophy  but what is much better  of ignorance <EOS> <SOS>  but with  me   it is not so <EOS> <SOS>  painful recollections will intrude  which cannot  which ought not to be repelled <EOS> <SOS>  i have been a selfish being all my life  in practice  though not in principle <EOS> <SOS>  as a child i was taught what was  right   but i was not taught to correct my temper <EOS> <SOS>  i was given good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit <EOS> <SOS>  unfortunately an only son   for many years an only  child   i was spoilt by my parents  who though good themselves   my father particularly  all that was benevolent and amiable   allowed  encouraged  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing  to care for none beyond my own family circle  to think meanly of all the rest of the world  to  wish  at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own <EOS> <SOS>  such i was  from eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been but for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  what do i not owe you <EOS> <SOS>  you taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous <EOS> <SOS>  by you  i was properly humbled <EOS> <SOS>  i came to you without a doubt of my reception <EOS> <SOS>  you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased <EOS> <SOS>    had you then persuaded yourself that i should <EOS> <SOS>    indeed i had <EOS> <SOS>  what will you think of my vanity <EOS> <SOS>  i believed you to be wishing  expecting my addresses <EOS> <SOS>    my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally i assure you <EOS> <SOS>  i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might often lead me wrong <EOS> <SOS>  how you must have hated me after  that  evening <EOS> <SOS>    hate you <EOS> <SOS>  i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began to take a proper direction <EOS> <SOS>    i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met at pemberley <EOS> <SOS>  you blamed me for coming <EOS> <SOS>    no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise <EOS> <SOS>    your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed by you <EOS> <SOS>  my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness  and i confess that i did not expect to receive  more  than my due <EOS> <SOS>    my object  then    replied darcy   was to shew you  by every civility in my power  that i was not so mean as to resent the past  and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill opinion  by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to <EOS> <SOS>  how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell  but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you <EOS> <SOS>   he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister  had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there  had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend <EOS> <SOS>  she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a subject to each  to be dwelt on farther <EOS> <SOS>  after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy to know any thing about it  they found at last  on examining their watches  that it was time to be at home <EOS> <SOS>   what could become of mr bingley and jane <EOS> <SOS>   was a wonder which introduced the discussion of  their  affairs <EOS> <SOS>  darcy was delighted with their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest information of it <EOS> <SOS>   i must ask whether you were surprised <EOS> <SOS>   said elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>   not at all <EOS> <SOS>  when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen <EOS> <SOS>    that is to say  you had given your permission <EOS> <SOS>  i guessed as much <EOS> <SOS>   and though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had been pretty much the case <EOS> <SOS>   on the evening before my going to london   said he  i made a confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago <EOS> <SOS>  i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs  absurd and impertinent <EOS> <SOS>  his surprise was great <EOS> <SOS>  he had never had the slightest suspicion <EOS> <SOS>  i told him  moreover  that i believed myself mistaken in supposing  as i had done  that your sister was indifferent to him  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated  i felt no doubt of their happiness together <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend <EOS> <SOS>   did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you told him that my sister loved him  or merely from my information last spring <EOS> <SOS>    from the former <EOS> <SOS>  i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here  and i was convinced of her affection <EOS> <SOS>    and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate conviction to him <EOS> <SOS>    it did <EOS> <SOS>  bingley is most unaffectedly modest <EOS> <SOS>  his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case  but his reliance on mine  made every thing easy <EOS> <SOS>  i was obliged to confess one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended him <EOS> <SOS>  i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter  that i had known it  and purposely kept it from him <EOS> <SOS>  he was angry <EOS> <SOS>  but his anger  i am persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments <EOS> <SOS>  he has heartily forgiven me now <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable  but she checked herself <EOS> <SOS>  she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at  and it was rather too early to begin <EOS> <SOS>  in anticipating the happiness of bingley  which of course was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation till they reached the house <EOS> <SOS>  in the hall they parted <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xvii <EOS> <SOS>   my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to <EOS> <SOS>   was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room  and from all the others when they sat down to table <EOS> <SOS>  she had only to say in reply  that they had wandered about  till she was beyond her own knowledge <EOS> <SOS>  she coloured as she spoke  but neither that  nor any thing else  awakened a suspicion of the truth <EOS> <SOS>  the evening passed quietly  unmarked by any thing extraordinary <EOS> <SOS>  the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged were silent <EOS> <SOS>  darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth  and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather  knew  that she was happy  than  felt  herself to be so  for  besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils before her <EOS> <SOS>  she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known  she was aware that no one liked him but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a  dislike  which not all his fortune and consequence might do away <EOS> <SOS>  at night she opened her heart to jane <EOS> <SOS>  though suspicion was very far from missennet s general habits  she was absolutely incredulous here <EOS> <SOS>   you are joking  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  this cannot be <EOS> <SOS>   engaged to mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  no  no  you shall not deceive me <EOS> <SOS>  i know it to be impossible <EOS> <SOS>    this is a wretched beginning indeed <EOS> <SOS>  my sole dependence was on you  and i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not <EOS> <SOS>  yet  indeed  i am in earnest <EOS> <SOS>  i speak nothing but the truth <EOS> <SOS>  he still loves me  and we are engaged <EOS> <SOS>   jane looked at her doubtingly <EOS> <SOS>   oh  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  it cannot be <EOS> <SOS>  i know how much you dislike him <EOS> <SOS>    you know nothing of the matter <EOS> <SOS>   that  is all to be forgot <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now <EOS> <SOS>  but in such cases as these  a good memory is unpardonable <EOS> <SOS>  this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself <EOS> <SOS>   missennet still looked all amazement <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth again  and more seriously assured her of its truth <EOS> <SOS>   good heaven <EOS> <SOS>  can it be really so <EOS> <SOS>  yet now i must believe you   cried jane <EOS> <SOS>   my dear  dear lizzy  i would  i do congratulate you  but are you certain <EOS> <SOS>  forgive the question  are you quite certain that you can be happy with him <EOS> <SOS>    there can be no doubt of that <EOS> <SOS>  it is settled between us already  that we are to be the happiest couple in the world <EOS> <SOS>  but are you pleased  jane <EOS> <SOS>  shall you like to have such a brother <EOS> <SOS>    very  very much <EOS> <SOS>  nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight <EOS> <SOS>  but we considered it  we talked of it as impossible <EOS> <SOS>  and do you really love him quite well enough <EOS> <SOS>  oh  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  do any thing rather than marry without affection <EOS> <SOS>  are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do <EOS> <SOS>    oh  yes <EOS> <SOS>  you will only think i feel  more  than i ought to do  when i tell you all <EOS> <SOS>    what do you mean <EOS> <SOS>    why  i must confess  that i love him better than i do bingley <EOS> <SOS>  i am afraid you will be angry <EOS> <SOS>    my dearest sister  now  be  be serious <EOS> <SOS>  i want to talk very seriously <EOS> <SOS>  let me know every thing that i am to know  without delay <EOS> <SOS>  will you tell me how long you have loved him <EOS> <SOS>    it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it began <EOS> <SOS>  but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley <EOS> <SOS>   another intreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment <EOS> <SOS>  when convinced on that article  missennet had nothing farther to wish <EOS> <SOS>   now i am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as myself <EOS> <SOS>  i always had a value for him <EOS> <SOS>  were it for nothing but his love of you  i must always have esteemed him  but now  as bingley s friend and your husband  there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me <EOS> <SOS>  but lizzy  you have been very sly  very reserved with me <EOS> <SOS>  how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton <EOS> <SOS>  i owe all that i know of it  to another  not to you <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy <EOS> <SOS>  she had been unwilling to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend <EOS> <SOS>  but now she would no longer conceal from her  his share in lydia s marriage <EOS> <SOS>  all was acknowledged  and half the night spent in conversation <EOS> <SOS>                                            good gracious <EOS> <SOS>   cried mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet  as she stood at a window the next morning   if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley <EOS> <SOS>  what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here <EOS> <SOS>  i had no notion but he would go a shooting  or something or other  and not disturb us with his company <EOS> <SOS>  what shall we do with him <EOS> <SOS>  lizzy  you must walk out with him again  that he may not be in bingley s way <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal  yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet <EOS> <SOS>  as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good information  and he soon afterwards said aloud   mr bennet  have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day <EOS> <SOS>    i advise mr darcy  and lizzy  and kitty   said mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet   to walk to oakham mount this morning <EOS> <SOS>  it is a nice long walk  and mr darcy has never seen the view <EOS> <SOS>    it may do very well for the others   replied mr bingley   but i am sure it will be too much for kitty <EOS> <SOS>  wont it  kitty <EOS> <SOS>   kitty owned that she had rather stay at home <EOS> <SOS>  darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently consented <EOS> <SOS>  as she went up stairs to get ready  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet followed her  saying   i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself <EOS> <SOS>  but i hope you will not mind it  it is all for jane s sake  you know  and there is no occasion for talking to him  except just now and then <EOS> <SOS>  so  do not put yourself to inconvenience <EOS> <SOS>   during their walk  it was resolved that mr bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s <EOS> <SOS>  she could not determine how her mother would take it  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man <EOS> <SOS>  but whether she were violently set against the match  or violently delighted with it  it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense  and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her disapprobation <EOS> <SOS>                                           in the evening  soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library  she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on seeing it was extreme <EOS> <SOS>  she did not fear her father s opposition  but he was going to be made unhappy  and that it should be through her means  that  she   his favourite child  should be distressing him by her choice  should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her  was a wretched reflection  and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again  when  looking at him  she was a little relieved by his smile <EOS> <SOS>  in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while pretending to admire her work  said in a whisper   go to your father  he wants you in the library <EOS> <SOS>   she was gone directly <EOS> <SOS>  her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious <EOS> <SOS>   lizzy   said he   what are you doing <EOS> <SOS>  are you out of your senses  to be accepting this man <EOS> <SOS>  have not you always hated him <EOS> <SOS>   how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable  her expressions more moderate <EOS> <SOS>  it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give  but they were now necessary  and she assured him with some confusion  of her attachment to mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>   or in other words  you are determined to have him <EOS> <SOS>  he is rich  to be sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane <EOS> <SOS>  but will they make you happy <EOS> <SOS>    have you any other objection   said elizabeth   than your belief of my indifference <EOS> <SOS>    none at all <EOS> <SOS>  we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of man  but this would be nothing if you really liked him <EOS> <SOS>    i do  i do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   i love him <EOS> <SOS>  indeed he has no improper pride <EOS> <SOS>  he is perfectly amiable <EOS> <SOS>  you do not know what he really is  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms <EOS> <SOS>    lizzy   said her father   i have given him my consent <EOS> <SOS>  he is the kind of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse any thing  which he condescended to ask <EOS> <SOS>  i now give it to  you   if you are resolved on having him <EOS> <SOS>  but let me advise you to think better of it <EOS> <SOS>  i know your disposition  lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable  unless you truly esteemed your husband  unless you looked up to him as a superior <EOS> <SOS>  your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage <EOS> <SOS>  you could scarcely escape discredit and misery <EOS> <SOS>  my child  let me not have the grief of seeing  you  unable to respect your partner in life <EOS> <SOS>  you know not what you are about <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply  and at length  by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had stood the test of many months suspense  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father s incredulity  and reconcile him to the match <EOS> <SOS>   well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   i have no more to say <EOS> <SOS>  if this be the case  he deserves you <EOS> <SOS>  i could not have parted with you  my lizzy  to any one less worthy <EOS> <SOS>   to complete the favourable impression  she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia <EOS> <SOS>  he heard her with astonishment <EOS> <SOS>   this is an evening of wonders  indeed <EOS> <SOS>  and so  darcy did every thing  made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow s debts  and got him his commission <EOS> <SOS>  so much the better <EOS> <SOS>  it will save me a world of trouble and economy <EOS> <SOS>  had it been your uncle s doing  i must and  would  have paid him  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way <EOS> <SOS>  i shall offer to pay him to morrow  he will rant and storm about his love for you  and there will be an end of the matter <EOS> <SOS>   he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his reading mr collins s letter  and after laughing at her some time  allowed her at last to go  saying  as she quitted the room   if any young men come for mary or kitty  send them in  for i am quite at leisure <EOS> <SOS>   elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and  after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room  she was able to join the others with tolerable composure <EOS> <SOS>  every thing was too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away  there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time <EOS> <SOS>  when her mother went up to her dressing room at night  she followed her  and made the important communication <EOS> <SOS>  its effect was most extraordinary  for on first hearing it  mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet sat quite still  and unable to utter a syllable <EOS> <SOS>  nor was it under many  many minutes  that she could comprehend what she heard  though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them <EOS> <SOS>  she began at length to recover  to fidget about in her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself <EOS> <SOS>   good gracious <EOS> <SOS>  lord bless me <EOS> <SOS>  only think <EOS> <SOS>  dear me <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  who would have thought it <EOS> <SOS>  and is it really true <EOS> <SOS>  oh <EOS> <SOS>  my sweetest lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  how rich and how great you will be <EOS> <SOS>  what pin money  what jewels  what carriages you will have <EOS> <SOS>  jane s is nothing to it  nothing at all <EOS> <SOS>  i am so pleased  so happy <EOS> <SOS>  such a charming man <EOS> <SOS>   so handsome <EOS> <SOS>  so tall <EOS> <SOS>   oh  my dear lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before <EOS> <SOS>  i hope he will overlook it <EOS> <SOS>  dear  dear lizzy <EOS> <SOS>  a house in town <EOS> <SOS>  every thing that is charming <EOS> <SOS>  three daughters married <EOS> <SOS>  ten thousand a year <EOS> <SOS>  oh  lord <EOS> <SOS>  what will become of me <EOS> <SOS>  i shall go distracted <EOS> <SOS>   this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted  and elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself  soon went away <EOS> <SOS>  but before she had been three minutes in her own room  her mother followed her <EOS> <SOS>   my dearest child   she cried   i can think of nothing else <EOS> <SOS>  ten thousand a year  and very likely more <EOS> <SOS>   tis as good as a lord <EOS> <SOS>  and a special licence <EOS> <SOS>  you must and shall be married by a special licence <EOS> <SOS>  but my dearest love  tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of  that i may have it to morrow <EOS> <SOS>   this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be  and elizabeth found  that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of her relations  consent  there was still something to be wished for <EOS> <SOS>  but the morrow passed off much better than she expected  for mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law  that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his opinion <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him  and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem <EOS> <SOS>   i admire all my three sons in law highly   said he <EOS> <SOS>   wickham  perhaps  is my favourite  but i think i shall like  your  husband quite as well as jane s <EOS> <SOS>   chapter xviii <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her <EOS> <SOS>   how could you begin <EOS> <SOS>   said she <EOS> <SOS>   i can comprehend your going on charmingly  when you had once made a beginning  but what could set you off in the first place <EOS> <SOS>    i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the words  which laid the foundation <EOS> <SOS>  it is too long ago <EOS> <SOS>  i was in the middle before i knew that i  had  begun <EOS> <SOS>    my beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners  my behaviour to  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil  and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not <EOS> <SOS>  now be sincere  did you admire me for my impertinence <EOS> <SOS>    for the liveliness of your mind  i did <EOS> <SOS>    you may as well call it impertinence at once <EOS> <SOS>  it was very little less <EOS> <SOS>  the fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference  of officious attention <EOS> <SOS>  you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking  and thinking for  your  approbation alone <EOS> <SOS>  i roused  and interested you  because i was so unlike  them  <EOS> <SOS>  had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and in your heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you <EOS> <SOS>  there  i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it perfectly reasonable <EOS> <SOS>  to be sure  you knew no actual good of me  but nobody thinks of  that  when they fall in love <EOS> <SOS>    was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane  while she was ill at netherfield <EOS> <SOS>    dearest jane <EOS> <SOS>  who could have done less for her <EOS> <SOS>  but make a virtue of it by all means <EOS> <SOS>  my good qualities are under your protection  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible  and  in return  it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last <EOS> <SOS>  what made you so shy of me  when you first called  and afterwards dined here <EOS> <SOS>  why  especially  when you called  did you look as if you did not care about me <EOS> <SOS>    because you were grave and silent  and gave me no encouragement <EOS> <SOS>    but i was embarrassed <EOS> <SOS>    and so was i <EOS> <SOS>    you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner <EOS> <SOS>    a man who had felt less  might <EOS> <SOS>    how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give  and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it <EOS> <SOS>  but i wonder how long you  would  have gone on  if you had been left to yourself <EOS> <SOS>  i wonder when you  would  have spoken  if i had not asked you <EOS> <SOS>  my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect <EOS> <SOS>   too much   i am afraid  for what becomes of the moral  if our comfort springs from a breach of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the subject <EOS> <SOS>  this will never do <EOS> <SOS>    you need not distress yourself <EOS> <SOS>  the moral will be perfectly fair <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us  were the means of removing all my doubts <EOS> <SOS>  i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude <EOS> <SOS>  i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s <EOS> <SOS>  my aunt s intelligence had given me hope  and i was determined at once to know every thing <EOS> <SOS>    lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her happy  for she loves to be of use <EOS> <SOS>  but tell me  what did you come down to netherfield for <EOS> <SOS>  was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed <EOS> <SOS>  or had you intended any more serious consequence <EOS> <SOS>    my real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if i could  whether i might ever hope to make you love me <EOS> <SOS>  my avowed one  or what i avowed to myself  was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley  and if she were  to make the confession to him which i have since made <EOS> <SOS>    shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine  what is to befall her <EOS> <SOS>    i am more likely to want time than courage  elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  but it ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it shall be done directly <EOS> <SOS>    and if i had not a letter to write myself  i might sit by you  and admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady once did <EOS> <SOS>  but i have an aunt  too  who must not be longer neglected <EOS> <SOS>   from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated  elizabeth had never yet answered mr <EOS> <SOS>  gardiner s long letter  but now  having  that  to communicate which she knew would be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to find  that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness  and immediately wrote as follows        i would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as i ought to have      done  for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of particulars  but      to say the truth  i was too cross to write <EOS> <SOS>  you supposed more than      really existed <EOS> <SOS>  but  now  suppose as much as you chuse  give a      loose to your fancy  indulge your imagination in every possible      flight which the subject will afford  and unless you believe me      actually married  you cannot greatly err <EOS> <SOS>  you must write again very      soon  and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last <EOS> <SOS>  i      thank you  again and again  for not going to the lakes <EOS> <SOS>  how could i      be so silly as to wish it <EOS> <SOS>  your idea of the ponies is delightful <EOS> <SOS>       we will go round the park every day <EOS> <SOS>  i am the happiest creature in      the world <EOS> <SOS>  perhaps other people have said so before  but not one      with such justice <EOS> <SOS>  i am happier even than jane  she only smiles  i      laugh <EOS> <SOS>  mr darcy sends you all the love in the world  that he can      spare from me <EOS> <SOS>  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas <EOS> <SOS>       your s   c <EOS> <SOS>   mr darcy s letter to lady catherine  was in a different style  and still different from either  was what mr bennet sent to mr collins  in reply to his last <EOS> <SOS>        dear sir        i must trouble you once more for congratulations <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth will      soon be the wife of mr darcy <EOS> <SOS>  console lady catherine as well as      you can <EOS> <SOS>  but  if i were you  i would stand by the nephew <EOS> <SOS>  he has      more to give <EOS> <SOS>        your s sincerely   c <EOS> <SOS>   missingley s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere <EOS> <SOS>  she wrote even to jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat all her former professions of regard <EOS> <SOS>  jane was not deceived  but she was affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved <EOS> <SOS>  the joy which missarcy expressed on receiving similar information  was as sincere as her brother s in sending it <EOS> <SOS>  four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight  and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister <EOS> <SOS>  before any answer could arrive from mr collins  or any congratulations to elizabeth  from his wife  the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge <EOS> <SOS>  the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter  that charlotte  really rejoicing in the match  was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over <EOS> <SOS>  at such a moment  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth  though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband <EOS> <SOS>  he bore it however with admirable calmness <EOS> <SOS>  he could even listen to sir william lucas  when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st <EOS> <SOS>  james s  with very decent composure <EOS> <SOS>  if he did shrug his shoulders  it was not till sir william was out of sight <EOS> <SOS>  mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance  and though mr <EOS> <SOS>  philips  as well as her sister  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged  yet  whenever she  did  speak  she must be vulgar <EOS> <SOS>  nor was her respect for him  though it made her more quiet  at all likely to make her more elegant <EOS> <SOS>  elizabeth did all she could  to shield him from the frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep him to herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure  it added to the hope of the future  and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either  to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley <EOS> <SOS>  chapter xix <EOS> <SOS>  happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters <EOS> <SOS>  with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mr <EOS> <SOS>  bingley and talked of mr <EOS> <SOS>  darcy may be guessed <EOS> <SOS>  i wish i could say  for the sake of her family  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children  produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible  amiable  well informed woman for the rest of her life  though perhaps it was lucky for her husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly <EOS> <SOS>  mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do <EOS> <SOS>  he delighted in going to pemberley  especially when he was least expected <EOS> <SOS>  mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth <EOS> <SOS>  so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to  his  easy temper  or  her  affectionate heart <EOS> <SOS>  the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire  and jane and elizabeth  in addition to every other source of happiness  were within thirty miles of each other <EOS> <SOS>  kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters <EOS> <SOS>  in society so superior to what she had generally known  her improvement was great <EOS> <SOS>  she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia  and  removed from the influence of lydia s example  she became  by proper attention and management  less irritable  less ignorant  and less insipid <EOS> <SOS>  from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept  and though mr <EOS> <SOS>  wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her  with the promise of balls and young men  her father would never consent to her going <EOS> <SOS>  mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mr <EOS> <SOS>  bennet s being quite unable to sit alone <EOS> <SOS>  mary was obliged to mix more with the world  but she could still moralize over every morning visit  and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters  beauty and her own  it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance <EOS> <SOS>  as for wickham and lydia  their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters <EOS> <SOS>  he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her  and in spite of every thing  was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune <EOS> <SOS>  the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  if not by himself  such a hope was cherished <EOS> <SOS>  the letter was to this effect        my dear lizzy        i wish you joy <EOS> <SOS>  if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear      wickham  you must be very happy <EOS> <SOS>  it is a great comfort to have you      so rich  and when you have nothing else to do  i hope you will      think of us <EOS> <SOS>  i am sure wickham would like a place at court very      much  and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help <EOS> <SOS>  any place would do  of about three or four      hundred a year  but  however  do not speak to mr darcy about it       if you had rather not <EOS> <SOS>        yours   c <EOS> <SOS>   as it happened that elizabeth had  much  rather not  she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind <EOS> <SOS>  such relief  however  as it was in her power to afford  by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences  she frequently sent them <EOS> <SOS>  it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs  under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants  and heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to their support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either jane or herself were sure of being applied to  for some little assistance towards discharging their bills <EOS> <SOS>  their manner of living  even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was unsettled in the extreme <EOS> <SOS>  they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation  and always spending more than they ought <EOS> <SOS>  his affection for her soon sunk into indifference  her s lasted a little longer  and in spite of her youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her <EOS> <SOS>  though darcy could never receive  him  at pemberley  yet  for elizabeth s sake  he assisted him farther in his profession <EOS> <SOS>  lydia was occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long  that even bingley s good humour was overcome  and he proceeded so far as to  talk  of giving them a hint to be gone <EOS> <SOS>  missingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage  but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley  she dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of georgiana  almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore  and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth <EOS> <SOS>  pemberley was now georgiana s home  and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see <EOS> <SOS>  they were able to love each other  even as well as they intended <EOS> <SOS>  georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth  though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm  at her lively  sportive  manner of talking to her brother <EOS> <SOS>  he  who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection  she now saw the object of open pleasantry <EOS> <SOS>  her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way <EOS> <SOS>  by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband  which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself <EOS> <SOS>  lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew  and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character  in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement  she sent him language so very abusive  especially of elizabeth  that for some time all intercourse was at an end <EOS> <SOS>  but at length  by elizabeth s persuasion  he was prevailed on to overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation  and  after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt  her resentment gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods had received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress  but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city <EOS> <SOS>  with the gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms <EOS> <SOS>  darcy  as well as elizabeth  really loved them  and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who  by bringing her into derbyshire  had been the means of uniting them <EOS>
